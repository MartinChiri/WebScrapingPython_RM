Since it was announced as the host city almost 12 years ago, it was always destined to be a World Cup of firsts.  From extreme weather to tournament debuts, CNN takes a look at the ways this year\u2019s competition will be breaking new ground.  Qatar debut  This will be the first time the Qatari men\u2019s national team will participate in a World Cup finals, having failed to qualify through usual means in the past.  FIFA, the sport\u2019s governing body, permits a host nation to take part in a World Cup without having to go through the qualifying rounds, which means the small Gulf state can now test itself against the best in world soccer.  Qatar is relatively new to the sport, having played its first official match in 1970, but the country has fallen in love with the beautiful game and the national team has steadily improved.   In 2004, The Aspire Academy was founded in the hope of finding and developing all of Qatar\u2019s most talented sportspeople.  In recent years, that has reaped rewards for its soccer team. Qatar won the Asia Cup in 2019, capping off one of the most memorable runs in the tournament\u2019s history, conceding only one goal throughout the tournament.  Seventy percent of the squad that won the trophy came through the academy, and that number has only increased heading into the World Cup.  Coached by Spaniard Felix Sanchez, Qatar will be looking to surprise people and faces a relatively kind group, alongside Ecuador, Senegal and The Netherlands.   \u2018Winter\u2019 Cup The World Cup has always been held in either May, June or July but Qatar 2022 will break away from such tradition \u2013 more out of necessity.  Temperatures in Qatar can reach over 40 degrees Celsius over those months so, with this in mind, the tournament was moved to a cooler time.  However, winter in Qatar is a relative term with temperatures still likely to be around 30 degrees, but organizers hope to combat the heat with multiple methods, such as high-tech cooling systems in stadiums.  The change in tournament dates has played havoc with some of the biggest domestic leagues in the world.  All of Europe\u2019s top leagues have had to work a winter break into their schedules, meaning congested fixture lists before and after the tournament.   Islamic country  One of FIFA\u2019s justifications for awarding Qatar the hosting rights was the ability to take the tournament to a new part of the world.  None of the 21 previous World Cups have been held in an Islamic country and this month\u2019s tournament will be a chance for the region to celebrate its growing love for the game. However, it undoubtedly raises a few problems that organizers have had to tackle. For many fans, drinking alcohol has, and will continue to be, a big part of the experience of such tournaments. In Qatar, though, it\u2019s illegal to be seen drunk in public, which has forced organizers to come up with inventive ways to circumnavigate the issue.  As a result, alcohol will only be served in designated fan parks around Doha and there will be separate areas for fans to sober up before and after matches.    Smallest hosts  Another question mark around the tournament is how the country will be able to deal with the influx of an expected one million visitors, given it\u2019s the smallest country to host the World Cup, with a population of just under three million.  As a result, all eight stadiums are in and around Doha, the capital city, and are all within an hour\u2019s drive of each other.    Organizers say the travel infrastructure \u2013 including buses, metro and car hires \u2013 will be able to cope with the increased pressure. One benefit of the small distances between venues is that fans will be able to see up to two games in one day. Should traffic be kind.  Due to its size, Qatar has also had to be smart with its accommodation. Two cruise ships, MSC Poesia and MSC World Europa, are being moored in Doha to provide some support to hotels.    Both vessels will offer the usual cruise ship experience, but fans won\u2019t be sailing any further than the 10-minute shuttle-bus ride into the heart of Doha.  For those fans prone to a touch of sea sickness, organizers have also built three \u2018Fan Villages\u2019 which will offer a place to stay on the outskirts of the city.   These include a variety of accommodation \u2013 including caravans, portacabins and even camping experiences \u2013 and all are located within reasonable distances of the venues.  Also, for those able to afford a little more, there will be luxury yachts docked in Doha\u2019s harbor, which can offer a place to sleep for, let\u2019s face it, an extortionate price.  \u2018Carbon neutral\u2019 tournament  FIFA has pledged to make Qatar 2022 the first carbon neutral World Cup, as world soccer\u2019s governing body continues its pledge to make the sport more environmentally friendly.   It, alongside Qatar, pledged to offset carbon emissions by investing in green projects and buying carbon credits \u2013 a common practice used by businesses to \u201ccancel out\u201d the impact of a carbon footprint. Qatar, the world\u2019s largest emitter per capita of carbon dioxide, has said it will keep emissions low and remove as much carbon from the atmosphere as the tournament produces by investing in projects that will capture the greenhouse gases. For instance, it will be sowing the seeds for the largest turf farm in the world by planting 679,000 shrubs and 16,000 trees.  The plants will be laid at stadiums and elsewhere around the country and are supposed to absorb thousands of tons of carbon from the atmosphere every year. However, critics have accused organizers of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d the event \u2013 a term used to call out those who try to cover their damage to the environment and climate with green initiatives that are either false, misleading or overstated. Carbon Market Watch (CMW), a nonprofit advocacy group specializing in carbon pricing, says Qatar\u2019s calculations are grossly underestimated. Female officials Qatar 2022 will also see female referees officiate a men\u2019s World Cup match for the first time.  Yamashita Yoshimi, Salima Mukansanga and Stephanie Frappart have all been named among the 36 officials selected for the tournament.   They will be joined by Neuza Back, Karen Diaz Medina and American Kathryn Nesbitt, who will be traveling to the Gulf nation as assistants.  Frappart is arguably the most famous name on the list after she wrote her name into the history books in 2020 by becoming the first woman to take charge of a men\u2019s Champions League match.  But looking to learn from her in Qatar is Rwanda\u2019s Mukansanga, who told CNN that she was excited to embrace the challenge of refereeing at a major tournament.  \u201cI would look at what the referees are doing, just to copy the best things they\u2019re doing, so that one day I would be in the World Cup like this,\u201d she said, adding that her family couldn\u2019t wait to see her take to the pitch. It\u2019s not yet decided when the women will be refereeing their first match at the tournament, but there will be some new rules to enforce. For the first time, teams will be able to use up to five substitutes and managers can now pick from a squad of 26 players, rather than the usual 23.   Qatar 2022 is set to start on November 20.

The 2017 indictment, released Friday by the District of Columbia court, said \u201cDuggan provided military training to PRC (People\u2019s Republic of China) pilots\u201d through a South African flight school on three occasions in 2010 and 2012. It lists unnamed co-conspirators including one South African and one British national who were executives of \u201ca test flying academy based in South Africa with a presence in the PRC,\u201d and a Chinese national who acquired military information for the Chinese military. Britain announced a crackdown on its former military pilots working to train Chinese military fliers the same week Duggan was arrested in Australia. Australian police provisionally arrested Duggan in the rural town of Orange at the request of the US government in October, pending a likely extradition request by the United States. Duggan\u2019s lawyer, Dennis Miralis of Australian law firm Nyman Gibson Miralis, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the indictment. He has previously said Duggan denies breaching any law, and is an Australian citizen who had renounced his US citizenship.  The court also unsealed a US warrant for Duggan on Friday. Duggan faces four charges, including conspiracy to defraud the United States by conspiracy to unlawfully export defense services to China, conspiracy to launder money, and two counts of violating the arms export control act and international traffic in arms regulations. He is now being held in custody in Sydney, and his case will return to a Sydney court this week. The US must lodge an extradition request for Duggan by December 20 under a bilateral treaty. Training foreign forces The indictment said Duggan was allegedly contracted directly by the unnamed Chinese national to provide services to a Chinese state owned company, including evaluations of Chinese military pilot trainees, testing of naval aviation related equipment and instruction on tactics related to landing aircraft on aircraft carriers. Duggan did not seek authorization from the United States government to provide military training to China, although the US State Department had informed him by email in 2008 this was required to train a foreign air force, it said. The indictment alleges he traveled frequently between Australia, the United States, China and South Africa between 2009 and 2012, when he was a US citizen and Australian citizen. Duggan\u2019s alleged violation of an arms embargo imposed on China by the United States also included providing aviation services in China in 2010, and providing an assessment of China\u2019s aircraft carrier training, it said.  The indictment alleges the Chinese national brokered a deal between the South African flight school and a Chinese state owned enterprise to provide aircraft carrier landing training to Chinese military pilots in South Africa and China. A T-2 Buckeye aircraft was purchased from a US aircraft dealer for this training, by providing false information that resulted in the US government issuing an export license, it said. Duggan moved to Australia in 2002 after a decade in the US Marines, later moving to Beijing in 2014 where he worked as an aviation consultant. He returned to Australia from China weeks before he was arrested, according to his lawyer. Reuters previously reported that in 2014 Duggan shared a Beijing address with a Chinese businessman, Su Bin, who was arrested in Canada in July 2014 and sentenced to prison in the US two years later after pleading guilty in a high-profile hacking case involving the theft of US military aircraft designs."},

Bout made the remarks in a video interview with Kremlin-controlled TV network RT. He was interviewed by Maria Butina, a Russian gun-rights enthusiast-turned TV personality who now works for the network.    In the interview, he denied any connections with the Taliban and that he supplied arms to Afghanistan.  When asked if he had a portrait of President Vladimir Putin in his prison cell, Bout said: \u201cYes, always. Why not? I\u2019m proud that I\u2019m Russian and that our president is Putin.\u201d  The former Soviet military officer was serving a 25-year prison sentence in the United States on charges of conspiring to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles, and provide material support to a terrorist organization. Bout, who had maintained his innocence, is believed to be in his 50s, with his age in dispute because of different passports and documents. Griner, 32, returned to the United States early Friday after being released from custody in an exchange for an international arms dealer. She was \u201cin good spirits\u201d and \u201cincredibly gracious,\u201d National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN.   Griner \u2013 who had played in the off-season for a Russian women\u2019s basketball team \u2013 was arrested on drugs charges at an airport in the Moscow region in February. Despite her testimony that she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil found in her luggage, she was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and moved to a penal colony in Mordovia in mid-November after losing her appeal. The swap, which US President Joe Biden confirmed on Thursday, did not include another American that the State Department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whelan. Whelan was arrested on alleged espionage charges in 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison in a trial that US officials have called unfair. The families of Griner and Whelan had urged the White House to secure their release, including via prisoner exchange if necessary.

Britain recorded the coldest day of the year during the early hours of Monday morning, with temperatures as low as minus 15.7 degrees Celsius (4 degrees Fahrenheit) in northern Scotland, according to the Met Office, the UK\u2019s national weather service. The cold snap left many parts of the country, including London, covered in snow from Sunday evening. The Met Office issued severe weather warnings for some parts of the country. Motorists were urged to avoid driving in several locations, with some forced to abandon their cars. Many schools were closed. Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports, which all serve the capital, warned of delays and flight cancellations.  Despite the disruption, the arrival of snow two weeks before Christmas brought a festive atmosphere to Britain\u2019s parks and streets.  Snowfall is relatively rare in southern England compared to northern Britain and mainland Europe, and Britons frequently gripe about the ill-preparedness of the country\u2019s infrastructure when cold weather hits. Inflation and an energy crisis have added to the concerns this year, as household bills have soared and people worry about whether they can afford to heat their homes.  National Grid, which manages much of the UK\u2019s energy supply infrastructure, has instructed two coal-fueled power stations to start warming up, in case the cold weather threatens the country\u2019s power network, Britain\u2019s PA Media news agency reported. The company said it was a \u201ccontingency\u201d plan, which aimed to \u201cgive the public confidence in Monday\u2019s energy supply,\u201d according to PA. Customers of some energy suppliers are also being asked to reduce their consumption for two hours on Monday evening, in a pre-planned test being run by National Grid. Sunday\u2019s snow dump came after several days of cold and icy weather which had already caused tragedy in Solihull, central England. West Midlands Police said three boys, aged 8, 10 and 11, have died in hospital after falling into a lake on Sunday afternoon. A fourth boy, aged six, remains in critical condition. \u201cSearches of the lake are continuing as we seek to establish exactly what happened and if anyone else fell into the water,\u201d police said in a statement on Monday."},

The streets outside Vyacheslav Tarasov\u2019s home on Ukraine\u2019s eastern frontline are pocked by shell blasts. The buildings around are mostly empty, windowless and cold. Bakhmut has been facing the relentless firepower of a frustrated Russian army for months. In its pursuit of an increasingly rare battlefield victory, Moscow has leveled buildings with rockets and missiles and sent endless waves of infantry to fight among the destroyed homes. Tarasov, 48, was sheltering from the shelling in his basement where he now has to live. But last week he dared to venture out \u2013 to buy vegetables to make the national dish, borscht. \u201cI don\u2019t know what was used,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut the force was incredible because my arm flew off, just like that\u2026 I was holding my guts in my hands.\u201d  His face pales as he relays the graphic images still fresh in his mind. \u201cI was wearing a leather jacket and if it wasn\u2019t for that, I would have blown apart. I mean, my guts would have been all over the place\u2026 I lost a lot of blood. I remember seeing it \u2014 a huge puddle.\u201d The blast that tore through Tarasov\u2019s body killed his friend and as the shelling continued, he realized he might not make it either. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth,\u201d he says. \u201cI prayed to survive.\u201d  Tarasov is a devout Christian and believes an \u201cinvisible power\u201d saved his life. He is also grateful to the Ukrainian soldiers who threw him in their pickup truck and drove him to a hospital in Kostiantynivka \u2014 one of the few remaining hospitals able to treat the war\u2019s civilian wounded.  When Tarasov arrived, he begged the doctors to save his limb. \u201cThe first thing I asked was if I could have my arm sewn back on. I saw that it was completely torn off and was just hanging in the sleeve. And my stomach was burning. I figured it must be the intestines coming out. There was blood everywhere.\u201d   Medical staff at Kostiantynivka have been continuing their work through power failures and water shortages caused by repeated Russian attacks on the energy grid. For eight hours one day last week, they had to rely on generators to keep the lights and heating on. \u201cSometimes the power goes out,\u201d chief surgeon Dr. Yuri Mishasty tells CNN, still dressed in his scrubs. \u201cWater comes by the hour, not regularly. There was no water at the weekend because there was a catastrophic shelling incident.\u201d The surgeon, 62, has just finished operating on a woman who had been rushed in earlier that afternoon.  \u201cShe\u2019s a resident of Bakhmut. She came under artillery fire and suffered a shrapnel wound to her abdomen with damage to several organs. We see people with these wounds every day. Every day.\u201d  As the Russian army intensifies its campaign to take Bakhmut, the shelling comes ever nearer to Kostiantynivka, 25 kilometres (about 15 miles) to the west. Since the beginning of the month, the town has been hit almost every day, the hospital director says.   Meanwhile, medical staff hear the constant thud of artillery fired around Bakhmut \u2013 unwelcome signals that another patient may soon lie on the operating table. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite loud lately,\u201d Khassan El-Kafarna, a surgeon from Medicins Sans Frontiers (MSF), stationed at the hospital, says. His colleague, nurse Lucia Marron, agrees. \u201cI think there\u2019s more movement around in general \u2013 more troops, more people,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are used to the sound. You get to a point where you understand what is dangerous and what is not.\u201d The local authorities have implored civilians to leave the region for months. But for Tarasov, as for so many in Ukraine\u2019s old industrial heartland, fleeing his home for a safer area had seemed impossible.  \u201cIf I had a lot of money, I would rather live abroad,\u201d Tarasov says. \u201cBut I have no money and everything I had saved up was invested there. I had no money and nowhere to go.\u201d  To stay in Bakhmut was to cling on to what remained of the life he worked so hard for during peacetime. That life has now changed irrevocably.  A builder before war came to Ukraine, Tarasov says, \u201cI was right-handed. Now I won\u2019t even be able to roll a measuring tape.  \u201cI\u2019m half-man, half-zombie. Half-human to be exact.\u201d "},

Those four nations share one World Cup appearance between them and that was when Panama played at Russia 2018, finishing the group stage with three defeats and conceding 11 goals.  Croatia\u2019s World Cup pedigree is an altogether different story. In six World Cup appearances, the country has reached the semifinals on three occasions, while four years ago Croatia contested the final, ultimately losing to France.  Croatia only gained independence in 1991, during the bloody Balkan war which lasted until 1995 and its population is just under four million, though you\u2019d never have known given the way it traded blows with soccer superpower Brazil in the quarterfinals, before winning a penalty shootout. That success was very much a case of David knocking out Goliath given Brazil\u2019s population is 214 million people. Next up for Croatia is Lionel Messi and Argentina \u2013 population: 45 million. Igor \u0160timac, who played in all of Croatia\u2019s 1998 World Cup matches during its run to third place, told CNN that the country\u2019s recent history has helped play a part in forging elite competitors.  \u201cOur people went through many difficulties in its survival, in its independence, fighting for it, in the aggression which we suffered from our neighbors,\u201d \u0160timac, who coached the Croatia national team between 2012-13, told CNN.  \u201cThese things are helping to stay with a great mental strength, great discipline, staying humble and surviving with the pride, whatever difficulties there are in front of us. \u201cBut we cannot say that only the last war which happened here helped in these things because the wars were going on through this region for many occasions. It\u2019s something also about this region in regards to the climate, in regards to the culture.\u201d Croatian football journalist Sr\u0111an Fabijanac, who has been on the ground in Doha to watch this current iteration of the national team, says the squad\u2019s harmony has proved vital in another extraordinary World Cup for the the Vatreni (the \u2018Blazers\u2019)  Fabijanac calls the team \u2013 constructed with a blend of experience from the likes of Luka Modri\u0107, Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107 and Dejan Lovren with new faces such as Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol and Borna Sosa \u2013 as like a \u201cfamily.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve seen what\u2019s happened in this World Cup; Brazil have excellent players, Portugal have excellent players, Germany have excellent players but in my opinion, they have spirit and they don\u2019t have a team,\u201d Fabijanac told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. Croatia is too strong as a team.\u201d  From the rubble After the collapse of the Soviet Union, democratic movements swept across much of Eastern Europe, including Yugoslavia. With the election of non-communist governments in four of Yugoslavia\u2019s six republics, the Federation began to crumble and ethnic divisions resurfaced. By 1991, the prosperous Croatian republic sought to create a loose confederation or to dissolve the union entirely. Less wealthy Serbia opposed this. In June of 1991, Slovenia and Croatia declared independence. Fighting soon began as the Yugoslav army, consisting primarily of Serbs, tried to prevent Slovenia from establishing its own border posts. In July, fighting also broke out between Croatian forces and Serb militiamen.  Among the other republics, only the smallest \u2013 Montenegro \u2013 sided with Serbia. The two remaining republics, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia, voted in favor of independence. In 1992, the Serbian minority in Bosnia, helped by the federal army, attempted to carve out enclaves for itself, laying siege to Sarajevo. By the time the United Nations dismissed Yugoslavia from its General Assembly, some 20,000 people had died and up to two million had become refugees from fighting and \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d Back in 2018, Lovren recounted his memories of his escape as a young child from war-torn Bosnia in 1992. \u201cI just remember when the sirens went on,\u201d Lovren said. \u201cI was so scared because I was thinking \u2018bombs\u2019 or that something will happen now. \u201cI remember my mum took me and we went to the basement, I don\u2019t know how long we\u2019d been sitting there, I think it was until the sirens went off. Afterwards, I remember mum, my uncle, my uncle\u2019s wife, we took the car and then we were driving to Germany.\u201d Lovren\u2019s family settled in Germany, but after seven years they were told to leave and had to start life again in Croatia. Fabijanac admits while some of the squad were not even born during the bloody Balkan war, it is something which still hangs over the country, spurring its players on.  \u201cWe want to put the things which happened in the 1990s far from us,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere are sports, but we have very strong national emotions and this \u2026 is why the Croatian football players always play with the full heart for the national teams.  \u201cBecause we are a small country, we have a very, very ugly war which made many traumas for many people in Croatia. \u201cAnd sports and players in football and in other sports are national heroes. And that is the reason why they always play for the national teams one level higher than the highest. When we play for the national team in football, in any sport, we play with more than 100%, we play with 110%.  \u201cThey put their last atomic force on the field to do something for the country.\u201d   A new story The Croatian Football Association applied and gained admittance to soccer\u2019s world governing body FIFA, in 1992 and Europe\u2019s governing body UEFA in 1993.  \u201cWe have football in the blood. Every male child in Croatia wants to be a football player,\u201d Fabijanac said. \u201cFirst they learn how to walk, after that they take a football or something to play football.\u201d Fabijanac added: \u201cFor a small country like us, it\u2019s very important to have this fantastic national team because my granddaughter is three years old and she doesn\u2019t play with dolls, she plays with the ball and says only: \u2019 Modri\u0107, Modri\u0107, Modri\u0107.\u2019 That\u2019s something which is amazing.\u201d  It didn\u2019t take long for Croatia to make its mark on the international soccer stage. First, Croatia reached the quarterfinals of the 1996 Euros \u2013 beating a star-studded Denmark along the way.  Two years later, in its first ever World Cup appearance, Croatia got to the semifinals of the 1998 edition in France, eventually finishing third.  Thanks to its first golden generation of players \u2013 led by Davor \u0160uker and with Robert Prosine\u010dki and Zvonimir Boban adding a sprinkling off stardust \u2013 Croatia qualified with two wins from its group, then beating Romania and Germany in the knockout stages, before losing out to eventual-winners France in the semifinals.   \u0160uker finished as the 1998 tournament\u2019s top scorer and with its distinctive red and white kit as well as its propensity for shocking football\u2019s traditional heavyweights, Croatia became an immediate favorite for neutrals.  \u0160timac said that his former teammates and squad had the responsibility of laying down the foundations for Croatia\u2019s modern soccer heritage. \u201cOur generation was the one that we had the most difficult path because we were responsible to create a cult of Croatian culture in football and to make the road for the generations to come,\u201d \u0160timac told CNN.  \u201cAnd as a newly recognized country, it was obviously very difficult when you are such a small country in the football world and nobody appreciates to consider you at all as important part or subject.  \u201cAnd from that point of view, we had the most difficult situation and we did well and that\u2019s obviously helped generations which followed.\u201d  The arrival of Zlatko Dali\u0107 as Croatia\u2019s coach in 2017 has also proved pivotal.  Having been appointed after the team\u2019s qualification for the 2018 World Cup, Dali\u0107 came with pressure on his shoulders. With many of the team\u2019s star players in their prime \u2013 in particular, the midfielder three of Modri\u0107, Ivan Rakiti\u0107 and Marcelo Brozovi\u0107 \u2013 Croatia was expected to perform well.  Croatia did better than just perform well.  Thanks to the harmony Dali\u0107 was able to engender in the team, Croatia exceeded everyone\u2019s expectations by reaching the final \u2013 showing remarkable grit and resilience to win twice on penalties followed by an extra-time victory over England in the semifinals \u2013 before being overpowered by France in the final.  Returning to Croatia and a hero\u2019s welcome, with more than 500,000 fans turning Zagreb\u2019s streets into a tapestry of red and white to celebrate the players\u2019 success,  the team was feted for surpassing the so-called \u201cbronze\u201d generation of 1998.  \u201cIn the past, we also had very good teams. In 1998, we had much better players maybe in the time like Boban, \u0160uker, Prosine\u010dki, (Robert) Jarni, but maybe they don\u2019t share the chemistry between them to do what this team has done in the past few years,\u201d said Fabijanac.  \u201cWe only have one star, it\u2019s Luka Modri\u0107. The other players are not stars, like Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 or Cristiano Ronaldo or Neymar. But the rest of the team is a family and does the most important thing for us.  \u201cWhen Dali\u0107 came to be head coach, when he chose the team \u2026 he looked for characters.\u201d With Modri\u0107 at his magical best and goalkeper Dominik Livakovi\u0107 in imperious form and with the team able to seemingly pluck a goal out of thin air when needed, this Croatia side has continued to surprise, just like it did four years ago.  \u201cWhen we come to represent the national team, all the egos need to disappear,\u201d said Stimac.  \u201cThere is no place in the national team dressing room of Croatia for big egos, and everyone knows that. No one is bigger than the team, no one is bigger than the manager and that\u2019s what is taking us forward.\u201d Back in 1998, \u0160timac came off the bench to face Argentina and the likes of Gabriel Batistuta and Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n.  On Tuesday, Croatia will meet Lionel Messi and the next generation of Argentine stars knowing two wins stand between them and a new age of glory. "},

The European side has, once again, upset the odds to reach yet another World Cup semifinal after beating tournament favorite Brazil in the previous round and, make no mistake, Argentina will have its work cut out if its to reach the final. The Croats took a dazzling Brazil team into the trenches on Friday after scoring a last-gasp equalizer to force extra-time and eventually a penalty shootout, which it won thanks to more heroics from goalkeeper Dominik Livakovi\u0107. The Brazilians, who lit up the tournament with its attacking dynamism, were prevented from playing their entertaining style of football by a well-drilled Croatian team with a resolute defence.  Argentina and Messi will have to be ready for such a challenge but the team has already demonstrated its willingness to dig deep to find a way to win at Qatar 2022.  Messi and co. were also forced into penalties before winning its quarterfinal against the Netherlands on Friday in a full-bloodied match which showed the South Americans will be no pushovers.  However, the fiery encounter came at a cost with defenders Marcos Acuna and Gonzalo Montiel both suspended after picking up cautions in the quarterfinals. There are also still question marks around Angel Di Maria\u2019s fitness meaning Messi will have even more pressure on his shoulders to inspire his side to its first World Cup final since 2014.  The magician has been in fine form during the tournament, already scoring four goals, but it\u2019s also been his playmaking ability which has been so devastating.   The 35-year-old may not have the lightning speed he once possessed but his passing and vision have been nothing short of remarkable at the tournament. His no-look assist for Argentina\u2019s opening goal against the Netherlands, for example, was a moment of pure genius. Despite the threat he poses, Croatia won\u2019t become obsessed with stopping just one player, striker Bruno Petkovic says.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have a specific plan yet for stopping Messi and usually we don\u2019t concentrate on stopping one player but the entire team,\u201d Petkovic told reporters on Sunday.  \u201cWe will try to stop them as a team and not with man-marking. Argentina are not only Messi, they have a number of great players. We have to stop the entire Argentina team.\u201d   Croatia, meanwhile, will hope its veteran captain Luka Modri\u0107 can inspire the team to another final after it finished runner-up to France in 2018. The 37-year-old has rolled back the years in Qatar and has kept alive his team\u2019s hopes of another soccer miracle with a string of classy performances.  He\u2019s been helped out by fellow midfielders, Marcelo Brozovi\u0107 and Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107, which, as a unit, will test Argentina on Tuesday.  \u201cMateo, Luka and Marcelo are the best Croatia midfield in history. I don\u2019t think it can be repeated. When you pass them the ball it is safer than having your money in the bank,\u201d said defender Josip Juranovi\u0107, per Reuters.  According to data company Gracenote Sports, Argentina is now the favorite to lift the World Cup trophy. \u201cThe team\u2019s [Argentina] chance of emerging victorious is 41%. France\u2019s chance of successfully defending their 2018 World Cup title is 26%,\u201d said Gracenote. \u201cSurprise semi-finalists Morocco and Croatia have 17% and 16% chance respectively of becoming world champions.  \u201cThe most likely World Cup final out of the four remaining possibilities is Argentina v France which has a 37.5% chance of happening,\u201d added Gracenote.

The attacks struck a number of different locations, including a church being used as a base by Russian forces, according to the city\u2019s exiled mayor, Ivan Fedorov, who shared a video filmed at night of a fire burning in the distance.  \u201cFireworks in the east of Melitopol,\u201d he said in a post on social messaging app Telegram on Saturday, claiming that 200 people were killed and 300 injured in heavy shelling on the city.  In an interview with Ukrainian television a day later, Federov rowed back on that number, saying that \u201cdozens\u201d were dead. He added that three sites had been hit, including a restaurant-hotel complex on the outskirts of Melitopol, known as \u201cPrival Okhotnika,\u201d or Hunter\u2019s Rest, a checkpoint 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the city in Novobohdanivka, and a military unit that was \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d near the village of Semenivka.  Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-installed governor of Zaporizhzhia region, where Melitopol is located, said that Ukraine had hit Melitopol using a HIMARS system, killing two people and wounding 10 others, three of whom were treated in the hospital \u2013 a significantly lower number than was reported by Fedorov. \u201cUkrainian HIMARS were launched on the outskirts of Melitopol. Two missiles were shot down by anti-aircraft defense, but four reached their target,\u201d Balitsky said in a post on Telegram on Saturday, sharing a video of emergency services responding to a huge blaze. He claimed the targets had included a \u201crecreation center,\u201d where civilians and military personnel were having dinner on Saturday night, but did not name it. Fedorov claimed in an interview on Monday that Russian troops in the city were \u201cpanicking\u201d and \u201credeploying,\u201d given Ukrainian strikes on the city. Without providing any evidence, he said \u201cthey are busy moving their military groups to other places to try to hide them.\u201d Melitopol, a southeastern city on the banks of the Molochna River, fell to Moscow in March soon after the invasion. The city\u2019s mayor was abducted by Russian forces and later released, while a pro-Kremlin administration was installed.  Melitopol lies south of the city of Zaporizhzhia and to the east of Kherson city, which was recently recaptured by Ukrainian troops. It is a major Russian logistics hub and has been in Russian hands for several months, but has come under fire from Ukrainian counter-strikes in recent weeks.  Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, underlined the importance of the city in comments made to local media outlet Feigin Live on Saturday. \u201cIf Melitopol falls, the entire defense (of the occupiers) to Kherson collapses, the Ukrainian armed forces jump right to the border with Crimea on the isthmus,\u201d said Arestovych. The attacks on Melitopol came as the Ukrainians also struck a hotel, which allegedly housed the Wagner mercenary unit in Luhansk. Heavy artillery, including the use of Grad missiles, was also reported in southern Ukraine\u2019s Dnipropetrovsk region overnight, Valentyn Reznichenko, the head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration, said on Telegram Monday.  Power deficit after Russian drone strikes on Odesa Kyiv\u2019s attacks come as Russian strikes ramp up on Ukraine\u2019s power grid, and growing warnings of the energy crisis gripping the country. Across Ukraine, crews are scrambling to restore energy capabilities faster than Moscow\u2019s troops can knock them out. It\u2019s a difficult, and increasingly dire fight as a long winter sets in. All of Ukraine\u2019s thermal and hydroelectric power stations have been damaged in the relentless Russian missile strikes targeting the country\u2019s power system, Ukraine\u2019s prime minister said Sunday. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that \u201cthere is a significant [power] generation deficit\u201d in the country\u2019s energy system, following eight waves of Russian attacks targeting critical infrastructure.  \u201cAll thermal and hydroelectric power stations were damaged, and 40% of the high-voltage network facilities were damaged to varying degrees,\u201d said Shmyhal. \u201cEach of us must realize that this winter we will have to live through with significant restrictions on electricity consumption.\u201d Russian drone strikes on Odesa, a key port city in southern Ukraine, plunged more than 1.5 million people into darkness over the weekend. Power and water supplies were gradually being restored to the city, but 300,000 still remained without power on Sunday, Odesa Mayor Hennadii Trukhanov said in a statement on Telegram. \u201cThe situation is quite controlled, although not easy,\u201d he said, adding that his administration was re-launching pumping stations and delivering water by truck to zones where shortages continue.  President Zelensky said Sunday in his nightly address that the country\u2019s forces had shot down 10 of 15 drones that Russia deployed over Odesa \u2013 a number that could not be independently verified. He called the strikes by Russian drones \u201ccritical\u201d and suggested it would take a few days to restore the electricity supply in the region. \u201cThe power system is now, to put it mildly, very far from a normal state,\u201d he said. The port of Odesa is Ukraine\u2019s key to exporting vital food products, including through its \u201cGrain from Ukraine\u201d initiative, which is aimed at addressing the global hunger crisis. Ukrenergo, the Ukrainian state run energy provider, reported that there was still a \u201csignificant power deficit\u201d in the grid. \u201cThe situation in Odesa region is still difficult, the restoration of power supply to consumers continues,\u201d it said in a post on Facebook, adding that the destruction caused by Russian attacks \u201cdoes not allow to fully use the capacities of thermal power plants, additional time is needed to restore their work.\u201d"},

Here\u2019s what you need to know about the deadliest terrorist attack to have taken place in the United Kingdom. What happened? On December 21, 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 exploded 31,000 feet over Lockerbie, Scotland, 38 minutes after takeoff from London.  Two hundred and fifty-nine people on board the New York-bound Boeing 747 were killed, along with 11 people on the ground.   Witnesses in Lockerbie and the surrounding areas reported portions of the aircraft falling \u201cfrom the sky, some of which appeared to be engulfed in flames,\u201d according to a 2020 affidavit by a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) special agent, shared by the US Department of Justice.  \u201cAs pieces of the aircraft hit the ground, some exploded. One such incident created an explosion that witnesses likened to a \u201cmushroom cloud,\u201d and left a crater approximately 40 feet deep where, moments before, residential homes had stood in the town of Lockerbie,\u201d the agent said in the affadavit. A three-year investigation Afterward, United States and British investigators found fragments of a circuit board and a timer, and ruled that a bomb, not mechanical failure, caused the explosion. Over three years, investigators from the United States, Britain, Germany and other countries questioned more than 15,000 people in more than 30 countries and collected thousands of pieces of evidence.  Authorities accused Libyan nationals Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi and  Al Amin Khalifah Fhimah of manufacturing the bomb, which they said was made out of Semtex plastic explosives, concealed in a Toshiba cassette recorder, hidden in a Samsonite suitcase and slipped into an Air Malta flight headed from Malta to Frankfurt, Germany.  The unaccompanied bag is believed to have been transferred to a Pan Am flight to London and then to Flight 103. The CIA and FBI said the suspects, employed by Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta, were also Libyan intelligence agents. Libya versus the West Then-Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi denied any culpability for the attack.  But after Libya was sanctioned by the United Nations for initially refusing to hand over the suspects for trial to face trial, it was agreed that the pair would be prosecuted at a neutral site in the Netherlands.  In 2002 the suspects were handed over to the UN. The following year, Libya agreed to pay $2.7 billion in compensation to families of those killed \u2013 paving the way for UN sanctions against the country to be lifted.  Convicted terrorist later released on compassionate grounds The trial of Megrahi and Fhimah began on May 3, 2000, and ended on January 31, 2001. Megrahi was ultimately found guilty and jailed for a minimum of 27 years. Fhimah was found not guilty.  In October 2008 it was announced that Megrahi was suffering from terminal cancer, and in August 2009, he was released from a Scottish prison on compassionate grounds. After being released, Megrahi returned to Libya and received a jubilant welcome. He died on May 20, 2012. New suspect brought to trial In October 2015, Scottish officials announced that two additional Libyans had been identified as suspects in the bombing.  Five years later, on December 21, 2020,US Attorney General William Barr announced criminal charges against former Libyan intelligence officer Abu Agila Mohammad Mas\u2019ud Kheir Al-Marimi in relation to the Lockerbie attack.  The apparent break in the case came after Mas\u2019ud was arrested by Libyan authorities on another case. A 2012 Libyan interrogation report claiming he admitted to making the Lockerbie bomb had made its way to US authorities, and in 2020, the FBI traveled to Tunisia to interview the former Libyan official who had taken Mas\u2019ud\u2019s statement.  Mas\u2019ud has been charged in a criminal complaint for allegedly providing the suitcase with the prepared explosive that was later placed on the flight. At the time he was in custody in Libya. On Sunday, the US Justice Department said that Mas\u2019ud was in US custody. "},

You leave one room and a team of people suddenly appears to rearrange it back to its pristine condition.  \u201cIt\u2019s a global yacht. It\u2019s usually in the Mediterranean every summer,\u201d Chorbadzhiev said.  \u201cThen, in the winter, we can go to the Far East or places including the Seychelles, Maldives, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong or in the Gulf region like here.\u201d The yacht had recently been in Abu Dhabi for the Formula One grand prix, but was delayed in getting to Qatar due to reams of paperwork needed to obtain a visa to enter the country, according to Chorbadzhiev.   Superyachts vs. tents vs. portacabins  While moored in Abu Dhabi for the grand prix, the yacht played hosted people watching the race from its decks which looked over a portion of the track.   Now in Doha, guests can organize limousines ferrying them to World Cup stadiums for the tournament\u2019s games. Guests can also request to take the yacht out of the marina to view the city from afar.  According to BOAT Pro\u2019s Global Fleet Tracker, more than 20 superyachts have entered Qatari waters since the start of the tournament, including vessels such as Al Lusail and Alaiya, which are moored around Doha.  A superyacht World Cup stay offers something very different from some of the other accommodation available to guests in the city during the tournament.  From tents in the desert to portacabins on the edge of Doha, World Cup organizers have had to be innovative in providing accommodation options to fans with the influx of an estimated 1.5 million people staying in a nation smaller than Connecticut. CNN visited one of the fan villages as fans started arriving ahead of the tournament. "},

Its shock defeat to Japan on the opening day put the Germans in a difficult position, but it rallied in its second game against Spain to earn a hard-fought draw.  It means the 2014 world champion, which sits bottom of the group on one point, now needs to beat Costa Rica on Thursday and hope Spain beats Japan in order to progress into the knockout stages of the competition.  A draw in the group\u2019s other game could be enough for Germany but its fate would then depend on goal difference.  Speaking after the vital draw against Spain, Germany manager Hansi Flick said he hoped his team would gather some confidence for the crunch match at the Al Bayt Stadium after a more positive performance against Spain.  \u201cMaybe it is the spark we need,\u201d Flick said. \u201cThe team fought hard and I am very satisfied with their mentality. These are the things we want and we know that we did take the first step. \u201cWe want to have the conditions against Costa Rica to reach the knockout phase.\u201d    Group leader Spain, meanwhile, needs just a point against Japan to ensure progression into the round of 16 \u2013 it can even afford to lose the match depending on what happens in Germany\u2019s game with Costa Rica.  Spain coach Luis Enrique is determined for his side to enjoy their experience in Qatar and has defended his streaming sessions online in which he talks to fans.  \u201cThe only goal I set for my players \u2026 before this training camp 16 days ago, I told them we need to have fun, fun,\u201d he told reporters.  \u201cWe need to enjoy this because you have to have joy in your job.\u201d It\u2019s a philosophy that seems to be working; with Spain\u2019s young side producing impressive displays on the world stage.

They must believe in their team mates in order to fight against our opponent.

Belgium, Croatia and Morocco can all still qualify for the knockout rounds in what promises to be a fascinating round of matches.  Belgium and Croatia will play each other, while Morocco faces Canada \u2013 which is already out of the tournament.  Many Moroccans will still be recovering from an emotional victor against Belgium on Sunday, in what was the country\u2019s first World Cup win since 1998 \u2013 and its third ever. \u201cIf we get through to the knockout stage, I think we will be very dangerous going forward,\u201d Moroccan manager Walid Regragui told reporters earlier this week.    Anything other than a place in the round of 16 will be a major disappointment for both Belgium and Croatia.  The latter was the defeated finalist in 2018 and needs just a draw against Belgium to ensure progression through the group. But coach Zlatko Dalic says he refuses to entertain playing for anything but a win.  \u201cWe must not accept the option of having only one point to end the match with Belgium,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThere are no easy games. Belgium need a win but we will also aim for a win.\u201d Belgium, meanwhile, has struggled to find its feet in the tournament so far.  It was largely outplayed despite beating Canada its opening game and suffered a confidence-knocking defeat to Morocco the last time out.  However, coach Roberto Martinez says his team will be ready for the showdown and hopes his star players, such as Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, can turn its fortunes around.  \u201cWe have to stay together now and become stronger.

The individual was slightly injured and is being treated at hospital, while police are investigating, Spain\u2019s foreign ministry said.  Kyiv\u2019s ambassador to Spain, Serhil Pohoreltsev, was the intended recipient of the envelope, it added. A separate letter bomb, which was deactivated at a weapons manufacturer in northern Spain late Wednesday, had the same return address as the one that exploded in Ukraine\u2019s embassy in Madrid, a senior Spanish official told Spanish radio station SER.  \u201cThe return address on the envelope is an email that is the same\u201d on both envelopes, Rosa Serrano, the top Spanish government official in the Aragon region where the second bomb arrived, told SER. The explosive sent to the weapons maker in the city of Zaragoza, in Aragon, \u201capparently came from Ukraine,\u201d Serrano said, adding that authorities suspect the one at the embassy may have come from Ukraine, too. An executive at the arms manufacturer was apparently aware about the Madrid explosion, so when an envelope arrived soon after, that no one seemed to recognize, the company called the police, Serrano said. The bomb squad arrived, a security perimeter was established and police determined there were explosives inside the envelope, designed to explode upon opening. It was deactivated, Serrano said.  Serrano didn\u2019t identify the firm, but Spanish media reported its name and said it manufactures rocket launchers that Spain has sent to Ukraine to fight against Russia\u2019s invasion of that country. CNN could not immediately confirm that detail. \u201cI know the firm has been an arms manufacturer a long time, with state-of-the-art facilities,\u201d Serrano said in the radio interview.

Nikolenko said no one else had been injured, and that Kuleba \u201chas issued an urgent instruction to step up security at all Ukrainian embassies abroad\u201d following the incident. \u201cWhoever is behind this explosion they will not succeed in intimidating Ukrainian diplomats or stopping their daily work to strengthen Ukraine and to counter Russian aggression,\u201d Nikolenko quoted Kuleba as saying. Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Jose Manuel Albares spoke to Ambassador Pohoreltsev after the incident, Madrid said. The person injured was a Ukrainian worker, according to the statement. Spain, a NATO country, has sent military equipment to Ukraine to help its armed forces fight Russia\u2019s invasion.

The law proposes to ban all Russians from promoting or \u201cpraising\u201d homosexual relationships or publicly suggesting that they are \u201cnormal.\u201d It also prohibits \u201cpropaganda\u201d of pedophilia and gender reassignment in advertising, books, films.

The nation was eliminated from the tournament in Qatar after its 1-0 loss on Tuesday, ending a campaign that has been overshadowed by anti-government protests that have raged for months at home. But there are concerns about the safety of the Iranian players returning home across the Persian Gulf, after the team initially refused to sing Iran\u2019s national anthem before their first game in an apparent show of solidarity with demonstrators. The team\u2019s families were also threatened with imprisonment and torture in advance of the match, a source involved in the security of the games said. People in several Iranian cities celebrated from inside their homes and residential buildings moments after the final whistle, which came in the early hours of Wednesday local time, while videos posted on social media showed people honking their car horns, chanting and whistling.  \u201cI am happy, this is the government losing to the people,\u201d one witness to celebrations in a city in the Kurdish region, who CNN is not naming for security concerns, told CNN on Wednesday.  The Norway-based Iranian rights group Hengaw posted several videos of similar scenes. \u201cPeople in Paveh are celebrating Iran\u2019s national team lose over America in World Cup in Qatar, they are chanting \u2018Down with Jash (traitors),\u201d Hengaw said in a post. Demonstrations have rocked Iran for several months, sparking a deadly clampdown from authorities. The nationwide uprising was first ignited by the death of Mahsa (also known as Zhina) Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman who died in mid-September after being detained by the country\u2019s morality police. Since then, protesters across Iran have coalesced around a range of grievances with the regime.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Chief, Volker Turk, has said that the country is in a \u201cfull-fledged human rights crisis\u201d as authorities crack down on the protests.  Football has become an increasingly heated flashpoint in recent weeks, with the World Cup throwing a global spotlight on the turmoil inside the country.  And fans following the team in Qatar have become increasingly conflicted about their support. \u201cOur team has been hijacked,\u201d longtime fan Farshad Soheil told CNN. \u201cIt no longer represents the people of Iran.\u201d  Soheili said Iran\u2019s regime has managed to politicize and weaponize the team, and was critical of the players for not making a grander statement about the protests. \u201cIt was a wasted historical opportunity,\u201d Soheili said.  Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s game, many supporters said they didn\u2019t want Iran to win. \u201cThe reason is not because of football reason, [but] because of political reasons,\u201d another fan called Farshid \u2013 who withheld his last name for security reasons \u2013 told CNN in Doha. \u201cI have mixed emotion(s) and feeling(s),\u201d Farshid said. \u201cI\u2019m a passionate supporter of Iran but today unfortunately I can\u2019t be supporter of the national team because of the current situation going on and the government trying to hijack the game and sport and using it as a platform to buy credibility and to show that everything is normal (with) what\u2019s going on in Iran.\u201d Farshid said a lot of pro-regime supporters have also attended Iran\u2019s World Cup games in Doha and created a very tense environment for other Iranian fans by attempting to interfere with their interviews with the media. Concerns over returning players Iran\u2019s national side would have progressed to the second round of the World Cup with a win or draw against the US, but the team will now travel home after its group stage exit.  \u201cI\u2019m really sorry on behalf of our players, our group, that we couldn\u2019t get our opportunity to qualify for the next round,\u201d midfielder Saeid Ezatolah told reporters after the game. \u201cI hope our fans and our people in Iran, they forgive us. And I feel just sorry, that\u2019s it.\u201d The team\u2019s return will be closely watched amid fears that the players could face retribution for a perceived brief show of support for the protests, which drew international attention and praise from human rights groups.  The country\u2019s flag and national anthem have been rejected by protesters as symbols of the current regime. And, following the refusal of Iranian players to sing Iran\u2019s national anthem in their opening match against England on November 21, a source involved in the security of the games told CNN that the players were called to a meeting with members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).  The source said that they were told that their families would face \u201cviolence and torture\u201d if they did not sing the national anthem or if they joined any political protest against the Tehran regime. The players sang the anthem on Tuesday, and before their second game against Wales last Friday, which saw 2-0 victory for Iran. Hours before the game kicked off on Tuesday, Iranian authorities said a former member of the national soccer team, Parviz Boroumand \u2013 who was arrested this month over criticism of the government \u2013 was released on bail, according to state news agency IRNA. Boroumand had been arrested in mid-November during protests in Tehran, Iranian media outlets reported. Earlier on Tuesday, Iranian-Kurdish footballer Voria Ghafouri was also released on bail. Iranian football legend Ali Karimi, sometimes referred to as the \u201cAsian Maradona,\u201d has meanwhile said he has received death threats through his family members after he vocally supported protests.   The government has described him as one of the \u201cmain leaders\u201d of the demonstrations, and issued a warrant for his arrest in early October charging him with \u201charmonizing with the enemy\u201d and \u201cencouraging riots,\u201d according to Iran\u2019s Supreme Council of the Judiciary, both charges that are punishable by death.

In a comment to CNN, Marcelo M\u00e9ndez, Messi\u2019s representative, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a kick to the jersey or anything like that as everyone can see on the footage.  \u201cI believe there\u2019s literally no one who can even question once Leo\u2019s fair play through his career. He\u2019s one of the most honest footballers ever, never cheats, always respects rivals \u2026 I reckon this debate doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Messi\u2019s former Argentina teammate Sergio Ag\u00fcero responded to \u00c1lvarez initial message on Twitter, saying: \u201cMr. Canelo, don\u2019t look for excuses or problems, surely you don\u2019t know about football and what happens in a changing room.  \u201cThe shirts are always on the floor after games have finished due to sweat and then if you look properly, he makes the movement to remove his boot and accidentally hits it.\u201d Mexico captain Andr\u00e9s Guardado also came to Messi\u2019s defense, saying that \u201cunfortunately, perhaps Canelo does not understand what is experienced in a locker room.\u201d \u201cThat is why I can understand the reaction of being offended by seeing the Mexico shirt on the ground and everything that has gone viral,\u201d Guardado told Argentina\u2019s TyC Sports. \u201cBut to me, it seems silly that this is being talked about because it doesn\u2019t matter much.  \u201cFor me, I repeat, Leo has had made many gestures not only with me, with many colleagues who know what he is like and beyond what has been said, it is purely to generate controversy or sell things.\u201d \u201cEvery time I have had the opportunity to ask Messi for something, a change of shirt or a photo with my son, he has always done it.\u201d Argentina would go on to qualify top of its group after a 2-0 win over Poland \u2013 despite Messi missing a penalty in the match \u2013 while Mexico agonizingly failed to qualify for the knockout stage despite beating Saudi Arabia 2-1."},

But St\u00e9phanie Frappart\u2019s traditional anonymity has been broken for a different reason \u2013 she will make history on Thursday as the first woman to referee a men\u2019s World Cup match. Alongside assistants Neuza Back from Brazil and Karen Diaz from Mexico, the Frenchwoman will form part of an all-female refereeing trio officiating Costa Rica vs. Germany in their Group E match. Six female match officials have been officiating at this World Cup \u2013 referees Frappart, Rwanda\u2019s Salima Mukansanga and Japan\u2019s Yoshimi Yamashita as well as assistant referees Back, Diaz and Kathryn Nesbitt of the US.  FIFA announced their appointment back in May, when Frappart found out that she was going to the 2022 Qatar World Cup. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise, you cannot believe it and after two or three minutes, you realize that you are going to the World Cup. It\u2019s amazing, not only for me, but also for my family and also for the French referees,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. Throughout her career, Frappart has achieved a seemingly endless series of firsts. In 2019, she became the first female referee to take charge of a Ligue 1 match, in August 2019 the first to take charge of a major men\u2019s European match, and in 2020, the first to officiate a men\u2019s UEFA Champions League match. \u201cI knew that my life changed after 2019 because most people recognized me in the street,\u201d Frappart recalls.  \u201cSo I am like a role model, for women referees but I think it [also] inspired some women in society or in companies to take more and more responsibility.\u201d Already at this World Cup, Frappart has been the fourth official on two occasions \u2013 becoming the first female official at a men\u2019s World Cup match at Mexico vs. Poland. Mukasanga and Yamashita have also been the fourth official at two and four games of this World Cup respectively. But there is an obvious tension between these historic moments for gender equality in football and the place in which they are happening as women\u2019s rights are severely restricted in Qatar. According to Amnesty International, women remain tied to a male guardian in Qatar\u2013 usually their father, brother, grandfather, uncle or husband \u2013 and require their permission for important decisions such as marrying, accessing reproductive healthcare and working in many government jobs. CNN has reached out to the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) for comment but at the time of publication had not received a response. \u201cI was many times in Qatar \u2026 for the preparation of the World Cup, I was always welcomed in a good way. I don\u2019t know how life is there but I didn\u2019t make the decision to go there or to organize the World Cup,\u201d Frappart says.  \u201cSo now, 10 years after, it\u2019s difficult to say something, but I hope that \u2026 this World Cup will improve life for women there.\u201d  \u2018When you\u2019re a woman, you need to prove you have the quality\u2019 At the World Cup, on football\u2019s biggest stage, the pressure of refereeing a game is at its most intense. A referee might make 245 decisions in a single game, Sky Sports estimates, and if just one is wrong, it will be analyzed in microscopic detail.  It could alter the course of a game, or even a team\u2019s World Cup \u2013 denying it a title or ensuring it progresses no further in the tournament.  \u201cWhen you make a mistake, it\u2019s more important than if a player makes a mistake \u2013 there are more consequences for the teams,\u201d Frappart says. \u201cIt\u2019s also easy to say that it\u2019s the fault of the referee and not the fault of our team so when you lose.\u201d As referees work their way up to the highest echelons of the game, this pressure changes. \u201cIt\u2019s more from the media and [about] the money because you know that every decision is important and will make a difference for the team,\u201d Frappart says. \u201cBut when you start in the local clubs, it\u2019s more difficult with the spectators and with the environment.\u201d Inevitably, female referees are heavily scrutinized too as they straddle two traditionally male-dominated fields: football and leadership. \u201cThere were many questions involved if she\u2019s there because she\u2019s a woman, perhaps she will not follow the game and everything,\u201d Frappart recalls when she made her debut in Ligue 1.  \u201cIt\u2019s not only in football, but I think in every job when you\u2019re a woman \u2026 you need to prove that you have the quality and after that they let you continue.\u201d But as Frappart refereed more matches, the stance towards her changed. \u201cNow, it\u2019s not a question of gender. It\u2019s now only a question about steel, [about] competencies. So now it\u2019s ok, after one or two games, they left me alone and without any more media around.\u201d \u2018I worked hard\u2019 When Frappart first began playing football at ten years old in 1993, women\u2019s football barely registered as a significant landmark on the sporting landscape. The inaugural edition of the women\u2019s World Cup had been held just two years previously, with great success in China, but there was neither a women\u2019s Champions League in Europe nor a National Women\u2019s Soccer League (NWSL) in the USA and professional female referees were non-existent. It was only in 2017 when Bibiana Steinhaus took charge of a Bundesliga match that a woman officiated a top-level men\u2019s league match. Frappart\u2019s appointment as a referee at a men\u2019s World Cup is another step forward in a \u201cvery sexist sport,\u201d Costa Rica manager Luis Fernando said, according to Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to reach the point that she has reached, I think it\u2019s good for football and a positive step for football, to show that it\u2019s opening up for everyone,\u201d he added. Similarly, in Rwanda, Mukansanga recalls never seeing a female referee to use as a role model for her own aspirations. \u201cI worked hard and followed the men\u2019s dreams because they were the people surrounding me,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. \u201cThey\u2019re all men. We had one World Cup referee here in Rwanda who went to the World Cup twice so he inspired me a lot and I kept working hard to be like him.\u201d With women refereeing and the matches at the Qatar World Cup broadcast to huge audiences worldwide, Frappart hopes that it will encourage more women to pick up a whistle. Already this change is beginning to take place \u2013 in the UK alone, there was a 72% increase in qualified women referees between 2016 and 2020, according to the FA.  \u201cSo if you have more referees on the TV perhaps it might make it easier for women to say, okay, this is possible. Because if you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible for us, you cannot say: \u2018Okay, I want to be a referee.\u2019\u201d CNN\u2019s Alasdair Howorth contributed reporting."},

Having failed to qualify for the last World Cup, the tournament in Qatar is the first time since 2014 that the USMNT has reached the last 16, which comes courtesy of hard-fought draws against Wales and England before Tuesday\u2019s win against Iran.  The team is now setting its sights on loftier ambitions.  \u201cWe\u2019re not finished yet,\u201d defender Walker Zimmerman told CNN\u2019s This Morning on Wednesday. \u201cI think the narrative continues, we\u2019re still going to try and do that and accomplish our goal of winning the World Cup.  \u201cI think if we\u2019re able to do that, we\u2019re going to inspire a lot of young players, a lot of young Americans to pick up the sport and, hopefully, make them proud.\u201d The USMNT\u2019s best performance at a World Cup in recent memory was reaching the quarterfinals in 2002 before losing to Germany. Gregg Berhalter\u2019s side goes into Saturday\u2019s knockout game against the Netherlands as the underdog, eight places lower than its opponent in FIFA\u2019s world rankings.  But that\u2019s unlikely to shake the team\u2019s confidence. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to get to the next round, but we want to keep going,\u201d Berhalter told This Morning.  \u201cWe had two tournaments that we\u2019re looking at: the group stage tournament and the knockout tournament. And now, we\u2019re here in the knockouts, we just want to keep this thing rolling.\u201d Against Iran, star forward Christian Pulisic scored the only goal of the game before leaving the field with an abdominal injury.  Berhalter said Pulisic will \u201chopefully\u201d be fit to play against the Netherlands and praised the Chelsea player\u2019s talent and work ethic.  Speaking on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America, USMNT captain Tyler Adams said Pulisic had \u201cput it all on the line.\u201d  \u201cHe\u2019s doing alright, he\u2019s in great spirits,\u201d Adams added. \u201cFeeling a lot better now, but what a big player for us, showing up in the biggest moments. We rely on him a lot for the big moments.\u201d Much of the buildup to Tuesday\u2019s game between the US and Iran focused on the political tensions between the two nations.  Iran state media called for the US to be kicked out of the tournament after US Soccer changed Iran\u2019s flag on its social media accounts to show support for the protestors in Iran. The governing body told CNN that it wanted to change the official flag for 24 hours to show \u201csupport for the women in Iran fighting for basic human rights\u201d but always planned to go back to the original flag. Iran appeared at the World Cup under the shadow of domestic turmoil following widespread protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died after being detained by Iran\u2019s morality police, allegedly for not abiding by the country\u2019s conservative dress code. Iranian security forces have since unleashed a violent response to the protests. There are concerns about the safety of the Iranian players returning home after the team initially refused to sing Iran\u2019s national anthem before its first game in an apparent show of solidarity with demonstrators. The team\u2019s families were also threatened with imprisonment and torture in advance of the match, a source involved in the security of the games said. At the end Tuesday\u2019s game, players from the two teams embraced in an apparent show of solidarity.  US defender Antonee Robinson was seen embracing a visibly distraught Ramin Rezaeian, who cried as he was embraced by the Fulham player, and comforting Abolfazl Jalali, who knelt on the pitch after the match ended.  Meanwhile, Josh Sargent, DeAndre Yedlin and Timothy Weah crouched to comfort Saeid Ezatolahi, who had buried his head in his hands as he sat on the turf and processed his team\u2019s loss.  \u201cWe know first and foremost as competitors what it\u2019s like to lose,\u201d said Zimmerman. \u201cWe also know the stakes of a World Cup, and then on top of that everything that they\u2019re dealing with emotionally.  \u201cWe just congratulated them on their effort and empathized with them and let them know that we\u2019re proud of the way that they competed on the field in the game last night.\u201d CNN\u2019s Matt Foster, Issy Ronald and Sam Kiley contributed to reporting.

In just 31 minutes on the court, the shooting guard shot 20-for-25 from the field and went 6-for-7 from deep, making it one of the most efficient scoring performances in NBA history. According to ESPN Stats and Info, he became only the second player in the last 25 years to score 50 points with 80% shooting accuracy in the first three quarters of a game along with James Harden in November 2017. \u201cIt felt like a double-sized rim out there,\u201d Booker said after the game. \u201cIf I rise up, it\u2019s going in.\u201d The 26-year-old guard and center Deandre Ayton \u2013 who finished with 30 points and 14 rebounds \u2013 dominated the first half, combining for 41 points and giving the Suns a 21-point halftime lead.  In the third, Booker took it to another gear, dropping 26 points to kill the game off \u2013 shooting 10-for-11 in the quarter.  Booker was on fire despite the Bulls\u2019 best efforts, ending the third quarter with a run of nine consecutive points including a dunk, a 29-foot triple and a four-point play. After he had won the game for the Suns in the third quarter, Booker was pulled for the rest of the game, but he did apparently have the option to keep piling up the points. \u201cCoach [Monty Williams] tried to put me in when they cut it to 18 \u2026 I didn\u2019t think it was necessary,\u201d Booker said after the game. Suns coach Williams said, \u201cThere\u2019s not a level where he can\u2019t score. \u201cHe can use both hands, he can score with a hand in his face and he\u2019s willing to take the tough shots.\u201d Bulls guard Zach LaVine, who finished with 21 points and seven assists, agreed, \u201cA guy like that gets in a rhythm and it\u2019s too late. He gets it going and it\u2019s over.\u201d Booker now has back-to-back 40-point games after scoring 44 against the Sacramento Kings and is making his case as an early MVP candidate. The win takes the Suns to the top of the Western Conference at 15-6, a record bolstered by a 12-1 tally at home. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many sellout crowds that is in a row, but it\u2019s impressive,\u201d Booker said on the support in the Footprint Center.  \u201cMondays, Tuesdays, Saturdays, it doesn\u2019t matter what day of the week it is. They show up and show out.\u201d But much of that success is down to Booker, who in this game took advantage of slack Bulls\u2019 defending to continue his hot streak and is now averaging just under 28 points per game. \u201cWe threw everything at him,\u201d Bulls coach Billy Donovan said on Booker. \u201cWe trapped him, we threw a box and one at him. We tried to face guard him and to his credit had had a great night.\u201d Fans were chanting, \u201cMVP! MVP!\u201d after Booker sunk a three-pointer in the third quarter. It might be a bit too early for that, but if Booker keeps on racking up numbers like he did tonight, he will become hard to ignore as the season progresses."},

The guest, Ngozi Fulani, is the CEO of Sistah Space, an organization that provides specialist services to women of African and Caribbean heritage affected by abuse.  Fulani was attending a royal function on domestic abuse organized by the Queen Consort on Tuesday evening when she said a member of staff began a line of questioning that the palace called \u201cunacceptable and deeply regrettable.\u201d Fulani said that the person persistently asked about her heritage and would not accept that she was a British national. Sistah Space shared a rough transcript of the conversation on Twitter on Wednesday. Fulani said that, after identifying herself as British-born, the person asked her \u201cwhere do you really come from;\u201d \u201cwhere do your people come from;\u201d and \u201cwhen did you first come here?\u201d  When Fulani answered she was from the London neighborhood of Hackney, the household member insisted: \u201cNo, what part of Africa are YOU from?\u201d as quoted on the Sistah Space twitter account. Buckingham Palace, which has not named the household member involved in the incident, said earlier today that the individual concerned had apologized and \u201cstepped aside from her honorary role with immediate effect.\u201d  Sistah Space said that it \u201cserves no purpose to name & shame\u201d the person in question on its Twitter account on Wednesday, adding \u201cit is the system that needs to be revised.\u201d  \u201cYes the person was offensive, but it serves no purpose to name & shame her, it would make us just as bad. We prefer that this be handled kindly,\u201d Sistah Space said. British media have identified the Buckingham Palace official as Lady Susan Hussey, who served as the late Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s lady in waiting for more than 60 years and is a godmother to the Prince of Wales. CNN has reached out to Ngozi Fulani and Buckingham Palace for further comment from the household member in question.  A Buckingham Palace spokesperson acknowledged the incident and said the palace was taking the situation \u201cextremely seriously.\u201d \u201cUnacceptable and deeply regrettable comments have been made. We have reached out to Ngozi Fulani on this matter, and are inviting her to discuss all elements of her experience in person if she wishes,\u201d the spokesperson said.  \u201cIn the meantime, the individual concerned would like to express her profound apologies for the hurt caused and has stepped aside from her honorary role with immediate effect.\u201d News of the encounter came to light as the Prince and Princess of Wales traveled to the US ahead of the second iteration of the Earthshot Prize Awards later this week. A spokesman for William said: \u201cRacism has no place in our society, these comments were unacceptable. It\u2019s right that the individual concerned has stepped down.\u201d The incident is likely to revive concerns that the palace is elitist and out of touch when it comes to issues of race and identity. The palace has, in recent years, faced allegations of racist behavior, including in its hiring practices decades ago and the treatment of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. A former counterterrorism police chief said Tuesday that Meghan and Harry had faced \u201cdisgusting and very real\u201d threats from right-wing extremists.  Meghan claimed in an interview with Oprah Winfrey last year that an unnamed member of the family made remarks about the skin color of their unborn baby while she was pregnant with Archie. Prince William later said the royal family was \u201cvery much not a racist family.\u201d Sign up for CNN\u2019s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what\u2019s happening behind palace walls."},

Alexis Mac Allister\u2019s scuffed effort 60 seconds into the second half broke the deadlock before Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez\u2019s brilliant curled shot sealed the three points as Argentina advanced as Group C winners.  The opener came after Messi, Argentina\u2019s all-time top goalscorer, had his penalty saved by Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny.  \u00c1lvarez\u2019s sublime finish midway through the second half capped off a nail-biting evening for Argentina, who will now face Australia. Poland advanced to the knockout stages by the skin of its teeth, qualifying on goal difference.  The other Group C game was a thrilling affair, Mexico beating Saudi Arabia 2-1, but the win wasn\u2019t enough for El Tri and Poland will now play France in a last-16 match on Sunday.  An enthralling evening Not for the first time in his career, all the pressure laid firmly at Messi\u2019s door, the 35-year-old endlessly striving to emerge from the long shadow which Diego Maradona has cast over the Argentina national side.  Playing in his 999th professional match, Messi looked up for the challenge, troubling Poland from the opening minute.  While the Polish attack offered very little throughout the game, Argentina cranked up the pressure \u2013 and both Messi and left-back Marcos Acu\u00f1a coming close.  Argentina was offered a great chance to break the deadlock when the video assistant referee adjudged that Messi had been fouled by Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny when he was hit in the face by the Polish goalkeeper\u2019s flailing hand.  However, Messi\u2019s penalty was brilliantly saved by Szcz\u0119sny\u2019s who somehow beat the ball away one-handed.  It was the crowning moment of a busy first half for Szcz\u0119sny, who finished the opening 45 minutes with nine saves to his name as Argentina piled on the pressure.  The penalty save was Szcz\u0119sny\u2019s second of the tournament already and he became only the second goalkeeper since 1966 to save a penalty at the World Cup having conceding it himself, after Joel Bats for France against Brazil in 1986, according to Opta Stats.  It took just under 60 seconds for Argentina to break the deadlock after the break.  A cut back cross from right back Nahuel Molina fell to the feet of Mac Allister whose scuffed effort just managed to sneak past Szcz\u0119sny and send Stadium 974 into delirium.  It was Mac Allister\u2019s first international goal, and continues his excellent year \u2013  he came to this World Cup as the top scorer for his Premier League club, Brighton and Hove Albion, this season.  That goal seemed to relax the Argentina players and fans inside the ground. Messi, \u00c1lvarez and \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda began to turn on the flair, toying with the Poland defense.  Midway through the second half, \u00c1lvarez showed why he\u2019d been brought in for this game \u2013 he\u2019d started the first two group games on the bench \u2013 curling home to get his first World Cup goal.  With Poland opening up at it attempted to claw itself back in the game, more spaces opened up for Argentina, with Messi, \u00c1lvarez and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez all going close. Group C\u2019s conclusion must have been an agonizing watch for Poland\u2019s fans. For a brief period of time during the match, Poland and Mexico were tied on goal difference. That meant Poland was slated to advance via its better disciplinary record.  With Poland fans checking their phones furiously to keep tabs on proceedings and with all eyes on whether any Polish players picked up a yellow card, there was one last twist to Wednesday\u2019s proceedings. That was delivered by Salem Al Dawsari\u2019s 95th-minute goal which gave Poland had a superior goal difference, assuring it\u2019s progression to the next stage."},

Everyone realized that this change is in the best interest of college football and pulled together to make it happen.\u201d The national championship game is scheduled to be played in Atlanta in January 2025 and in Miami in January 2026."}
