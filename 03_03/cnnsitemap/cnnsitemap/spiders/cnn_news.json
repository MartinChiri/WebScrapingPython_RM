Since it was announced as the host city almost 12 years ago, it was always destined to be a World Cup of firsts.  From extreme weather to tournament debuts, CNN takes a look at the ways this year\u2019s competition will be breaking new ground.  Qatar debut  This will be the first time the Qatari men\u2019s national team will participate in a World Cup finals, having failed to qualify through usual means in the past.  FIFA, the sport\u2019s governing body, permits a host nation to take part in a World Cup without having to go through the qualifying rounds, which means the small Gulf state can now test itself against the best in world soccer.  Qatar is relatively new to the sport, having played its first official match in 1970, but the country has fallen in love with the beautiful game and the national team has steadily improved.   In 2004, The Aspire Academy was founded in the hope of finding and developing all of Qatar\u2019s most talented sportspeople.  In recent years, that has reaped rewards for its soccer team. Qatar won the Asia Cup in 2019, capping off one of the most memorable runs in the tournament\u2019s history, conceding only one goal throughout the tournament.  Seventy percent of the squad that won the trophy came through the academy, and that number has only increased heading into the World Cup.  Coached by Spaniard Felix Sanchez, Qatar will be looking to surprise people and faces a relatively kind group, alongside Ecuador, Senegal and The Netherlands.   \u2018Winter\u2019 Cup The World Cup has always been held in either May, June or July but Qatar 2022 will break away from such tradition \u2013 more out of necessity.  Temperatures in Qatar can reach over 40 degrees Celsius over those months so, with this in mind, the tournament was moved to a cooler time.  However, winter in Qatar is a relative term with temperatures still likely to be around 30 degrees, but organizers hope to combat the heat with multiple methods, such as high-tech cooling systems in stadiums.  The change in tournament dates has played havoc with some of the biggest domestic leagues in the world.  All of Europe\u2019s top leagues have had to work a winter break into their schedules, meaning congested fixture lists before and after the tournament.   Islamic country  One of FIFA\u2019s justifications for awarding Qatar the hosting rights was the ability to take the tournament to a new part of the world.  None of the 21 previous World Cups have been held in an Islamic country and this month\u2019s tournament will be a chance for the region to celebrate its growing love for the game. However, it undoubtedly raises a few problems that organizers have had to tackle. For many fans, drinking alcohol has, and will continue to be, a big part of the experience of such tournaments. In Qatar, though, it\u2019s illegal to be seen drunk in public, which has forced organizers to come up with inventive ways to circumnavigate the issue.  As a result, alcohol will only be served in designated fan parks around Doha and there will be separate areas for fans to sober up before and after matches.    Smallest hosts  Another question mark around the tournament is how the country will be able to deal with the influx of an expected one million visitors, given it\u2019s the smallest country to host the World Cup, with a population of just under three million.  As a result, all eight stadiums are in and around Doha, the capital city, and are all within an hour\u2019s drive of each other.    Organizers say the travel infrastructure \u2013 including buses, metro and car hires \u2013 will be able to cope with the increased pressure. One benefit of the small distances between venues is that fans will be able to see up to two games in one day. Should traffic be kind.  Due to its size, Qatar has also had to be smart with its accommodation. Two cruise ships, MSC Poesia and MSC World Europa, are being moored in Doha to provide some support to hotels.    Both vessels will offer the usual cruise ship experience, but fans won\u2019t be sailing any further than the 10-minute shuttle-bus ride into the heart of Doha.  For those fans prone to a touch of sea sickness, organizers have also built three \u2018Fan Villages\u2019 which will offer a place to stay on the outskirts of the city.   These include a variety of accommodation \u2013 including caravans, portacabins and even camping experiences \u2013 and all are located within reasonable distances of the venues.  Also, for those able to afford a little more, there will be luxury yachts docked in Doha\u2019s harbor, which can offer a place to sleep for, let\u2019s face it, an extortionate price.  \u2018Carbon neutral\u2019 tournament  FIFA has pledged to make Qatar 2022 the first carbon neutral World Cup, as world soccer\u2019s governing body continues its pledge to make the sport more environmentally friendly.   It, alongside Qatar, pledged to offset carbon emissions by investing in green projects and buying carbon credits \u2013 a common practice used by businesses to \u201ccancel out\u201d the impact of a carbon footprint. Qatar, the world\u2019s largest emitter per capita of carbon dioxide, has said it will keep emissions low and remove as much carbon from the atmosphere as the tournament produces by investing in projects that will capture the greenhouse gases. For instance, it will be sowing the seeds for the largest turf farm in the world by planting 679,000 shrubs and 16,000 trees.  The plants will be laid at stadiums and elsewhere around the country and are supposed to absorb thousands of tons of carbon from the atmosphere every year. However, critics have accused organizers of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d the event \u2013 a term used to call out those who try to cover their damage to the environment and climate with green initiatives that are either false, misleading or overstated. Carbon Market Watch (CMW), a nonprofit advocacy group specializing in carbon pricing, says Qatar\u2019s calculations are grossly underestimated. Female officials Qatar 2022 will also see female referees officiate a men\u2019s World Cup match for the first time.  Yamashita Yoshimi, Salima Mukansanga and Stephanie Frappart have all been named among the 36 officials selected for the tournament.   They will be joined by Neuza Back, Karen Diaz Medina and American Kathryn Nesbitt, who will be traveling to the Gulf nation as assistants.  Frappart is arguably the most famous name on the list after she wrote her name into the history books in 2020 by becoming the first woman to take charge of a men\u2019s Champions League match.  But looking to learn from her in Qatar is Rwanda\u2019s Mukansanga, who told CNN that she was excited to embrace the challenge of refereeing at a major tournament.  \u201cI would look at what the referees are doing, just to copy the best things they\u2019re doing, so that one day I would be in the World Cup like this,\u201d she said, adding that her family couldn\u2019t wait to see her take to the pitch. It\u2019s not yet decided when the women will be refereeing their first match at the tournament, but there will be some new rules to enforce. For the first time, teams will be able to use up to five substitutes and managers can now pick from a squad of 26 players, rather than the usual 23.   Qatar 2022 is set to start on November 20.

The 2017 indictment, released Friday by the District of Columbia court, said \u201cDuggan provided military training to PRC (People\u2019s Republic of China) pilots\u201d through a South African flight school on three occasions in 2010 and 2012. It lists unnamed co-conspirators including one South African and one British national who were executives of \u201ca test flying academy based in South Africa with a presence in the PRC,\u201d and a Chinese national who acquired military information for the Chinese military. Britain announced a crackdown on its former military pilots working to train Chinese military fliers the same week Duggan was arrested in Australia. Australian police provisionally arrested Duggan in the rural town of Orange at the request of the US government in October, pending a likely extradition request by the United States. Duggan\u2019s lawyer, Dennis Miralis of Australian law firm Nyman Gibson Miralis, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the indictment. He has previously said Duggan denies breaching any law, and is an Australian citizen who had renounced his US citizenship.  The court also unsealed a US warrant for Duggan on Friday. Duggan faces four charges, including conspiracy to defraud the United States by conspiracy to unlawfully export defense services to China, conspiracy to launder money, and two counts of violating the arms export control act and international traffic in arms regulations. He is now being held in custody in Sydney, and his case will return to a Sydney court this week. The US must lodge an extradition request for Duggan by December 20 under a bilateral treaty. Training foreign forces The indictment said Duggan was allegedly contracted directly by the unnamed Chinese national to provide services to a Chinese state owned company, including evaluations of Chinese military pilot trainees, testing of naval aviation related equipment and instruction on tactics related to landing aircraft on aircraft carriers. Duggan did not seek authorization from the United States government to provide military training to China, although the US State Department had informed him by email in 2008 this was required to train a foreign air force, it said. The indictment alleges he traveled frequently between Australia, the United States, China and South Africa between 2009 and 2012, when he was a US citizen and Australian citizen. Duggan\u2019s alleged violation of an arms embargo imposed on China by the United States also included providing aviation services in China in 2010, and providing an assessment of China\u2019s aircraft carrier training, it said.  The indictment alleges the Chinese national brokered a deal between the South African flight school and a Chinese state owned enterprise to provide aircraft carrier landing training to Chinese military pilots in South Africa and China. A T-2 Buckeye aircraft was purchased from a US aircraft dealer for this training, by providing false information that resulted in the US government issuing an export license, it said. Duggan moved to Australia in 2002 after a decade in the US Marines, later moving to Beijing in 2014 where he worked as an aviation consultant. He returned to Australia from China weeks before he was arrested, according to his lawyer. Reuters previously reported that in 2014 Duggan shared a Beijing address with a Chinese businessman, Su Bin, who was arrested in Canada in July 2014 and sentenced to prison in the US two years later after pleading guilty in a high-profile hacking case involving the theft of US military aircraft designs."},

Bout made the remarks in a video interview with Kremlin-controlled TV network RT. He was interviewed by Maria Butina, a Russian gun-rights enthusiast-turned TV personality who now works for the network.    In the interview, he denied any connections with the Taliban and that he supplied arms to Afghanistan.  When asked if he had a portrait of President Vladimir Putin in his prison cell, Bout said: \u201cYes, always. Why not? I\u2019m proud that I\u2019m Russian and that our president is Putin.\u201d  The former Soviet military officer was serving a 25-year prison sentence in the United States on charges of conspiring to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles, and provide material support to a terrorist organization. Bout, who had maintained his innocence, is believed to be in his 50s, with his age in dispute because of different passports and documents. Griner, 32, returned to the United States early Friday after being released from custody in an exchange for an international arms dealer. She was \u201cin good spirits\u201d and \u201cincredibly gracious,\u201d National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN.   Griner \u2013 who had played in the off-season for a Russian women\u2019s basketball team \u2013 was arrested on drugs charges at an airport in the Moscow region in February. Despite her testimony that she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil found in her luggage, she was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and moved to a penal colony in Mordovia in mid-November after losing her appeal. The swap, which US President Joe Biden confirmed on Thursday, did not include another American that the State Department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whelan. Whelan was arrested on alleged espionage charges in 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison in a trial that US officials have called unfair. The families of Griner and Whelan had urged the White House to secure their release, including via prisoner exchange if necessary.

Britain recorded the coldest day of the year during the early hours of Monday morning, with temperatures as low as minus 15.7 degrees Celsius (4 degrees Fahrenheit) in northern Scotland, according to the Met Office, the UK\u2019s national weather service. The cold snap left many parts of the country, including London, covered in snow from Sunday evening. The Met Office issued severe weather warnings for some parts of the country. Motorists were urged to avoid driving in several locations, with some forced to abandon their cars. Many schools were closed. Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports, which all serve the capital, warned of delays and flight cancellations.  Despite the disruption, the arrival of snow two weeks before Christmas brought a festive atmosphere to Britain\u2019s parks and streets.  Snowfall is relatively rare in southern England compared to northern Britain and mainland Europe, and Britons frequently gripe about the ill-preparedness of the country\u2019s infrastructure when cold weather hits. Inflation and an energy crisis have added to the concerns this year, as household bills have soared and people worry about whether they can afford to heat their homes.  National Grid, which manages much of the UK\u2019s energy supply infrastructure, has instructed two coal-fueled power stations to start warming up, in case the cold weather threatens the country\u2019s power network, Britain\u2019s PA Media news agency reported. The company said it was a \u201ccontingency\u201d plan, which aimed to \u201cgive the public confidence in Monday\u2019s energy supply,\u201d according to PA. Customers of some energy suppliers are also being asked to reduce their consumption for two hours on Monday evening, in a pre-planned test being run by National Grid. Sunday\u2019s snow dump came after several days of cold and icy weather which had already caused tragedy in Solihull, central England. West Midlands Police said three boys, aged 8, 10 and 11, have died in hospital after falling into a lake on Sunday afternoon. A fourth boy, aged six, remains in critical condition. \u201cSearches of the lake are continuing as we seek to establish exactly what happened and if anyone else fell into the water,\u201d police said in a statement on Monday."},

The streets outside Vyacheslav Tarasov\u2019s home on Ukraine\u2019s eastern frontline are pocked by shell blasts. The buildings around are mostly empty, windowless and cold. Bakhmut has been facing the relentless firepower of a frustrated Russian army for months. In its pursuit of an increasingly rare battlefield victory, Moscow has leveled buildings with rockets and missiles and sent endless waves of infantry to fight among the destroyed homes. Tarasov, 48, was sheltering from the shelling in his basement where he now has to live. But last week he dared to venture out \u2013 to buy vegetables to make the national dish, borscht. \u201cI don\u2019t know what was used,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut the force was incredible because my arm flew off, just like that\u2026 I was holding my guts in my hands.\u201d  His face pales as he relays the graphic images still fresh in his mind. \u201cI was wearing a leather jacket and if it wasn\u2019t for that, I would have blown apart. I mean, my guts would have been all over the place\u2026 I lost a lot of blood. I remember seeing it \u2014 a huge puddle.\u201d The blast that tore through Tarasov\u2019s body killed his friend and as the shelling continued, he realized he might not make it either. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth,\u201d he says. \u201cI prayed to survive.\u201d  Tarasov is a devout Christian and believes an \u201cinvisible power\u201d saved his life. He is also grateful to the Ukrainian soldiers who threw him in their pickup truck and drove him to a hospital in Kostiantynivka \u2014 one of the few remaining hospitals able to treat the war\u2019s civilian wounded.  When Tarasov arrived, he begged the doctors to save his limb. \u201cThe first thing I asked was if I could have my arm sewn back on. I saw that it was completely torn off and was just hanging in the sleeve. And my stomach was burning. I figured it must be the intestines coming out. There was blood everywhere.\u201d   Medical staff at Kostiantynivka have been continuing their work through power failures and water shortages caused by repeated Russian attacks on the energy grid. For eight hours one day last week, they had to rely on generators to keep the lights and heating on. \u201cSometimes the power goes out,\u201d chief surgeon Dr. Yuri Mishasty tells CNN, still dressed in his scrubs. \u201cWater comes by the hour, not regularly. There was no water at the weekend because there was a catastrophic shelling incident.\u201d The surgeon, 62, has just finished operating on a woman who had been rushed in earlier that afternoon.  \u201cShe\u2019s a resident of Bakhmut. She came under artillery fire and suffered a shrapnel wound to her abdomen with damage to several organs. We see people with these wounds every day. Every day.\u201d  As the Russian army intensifies its campaign to take Bakhmut, the shelling comes ever nearer to Kostiantynivka, 25 kilometres (about 15 miles) to the west. Since the beginning of the month, the town has been hit almost every day, the hospital director says.   Meanwhile, medical staff hear the constant thud of artillery fired around Bakhmut \u2013 unwelcome signals that another patient may soon lie on the operating table. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite loud lately,\u201d Khassan El-Kafarna, a surgeon from Medicins Sans Frontiers (MSF), stationed at the hospital, says. His colleague, nurse Lucia Marron, agrees. \u201cI think there\u2019s more movement around in general \u2013 more troops, more people,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are used to the sound. You get to a point where you understand what is dangerous and what is not.\u201d The local authorities have implored civilians to leave the region for months. But for Tarasov, as for so many in Ukraine\u2019s old industrial heartland, fleeing his home for a safer area had seemed impossible.  \u201cIf I had a lot of money, I would rather live abroad,\u201d Tarasov says. \u201cBut I have no money and everything I had saved up was invested there. I had no money and nowhere to go.\u201d  To stay in Bakhmut was to cling on to what remained of the life he worked so hard for during peacetime. That life has now changed irrevocably.  A builder before war came to Ukraine, Tarasov says, \u201cI was right-handed. Now I won\u2019t even be able to roll a measuring tape.  \u201cI\u2019m half-man, half-zombie. Half-human to be exact.\u201d "},

Those four nations share one World Cup appearance between them and that was when Panama played at Russia 2018, finishing the group stage with three defeats and conceding 11 goals.  Croatia\u2019s World Cup pedigree is an altogether different story. In six World Cup appearances, the country has reached the semifinals on three occasions, while four years ago Croatia contested the final, ultimately losing to France.  Croatia only gained independence in 1991, during the bloody Balkan war which lasted until 1995 and its population is just under four million, though you\u2019d never have known given the way it traded blows with soccer superpower Brazil in the quarterfinals, before winning a penalty shootout. That success was very much a case of David knocking out Goliath given Brazil\u2019s population is 214 million people. Next up for Croatia is Lionel Messi and Argentina \u2013 population: 45 million. Igor \u0160timac, who played in all of Croatia\u2019s 1998 World Cup matches during its run to third place, told CNN that the country\u2019s recent history has helped play a part in forging elite competitors.  \u201cOur people went through many difficulties in its survival, in its independence, fighting for it, in the aggression which we suffered from our neighbors,\u201d \u0160timac, who coached the Croatia national team between 2012-13, told CNN.  \u201cThese things are helping to stay with a great mental strength, great discipline, staying humble and surviving with the pride, whatever difficulties there are in front of us. \u201cBut we cannot say that only the last war which happened here helped in these things because the wars were going on through this region for many occasions. It\u2019s something also about this region in regards to the climate, in regards to the culture.\u201d Croatian football journalist Sr\u0111an Fabijanac, who has been on the ground in Doha to watch this current iteration of the national team, says the squad\u2019s harmony has proved vital in another extraordinary World Cup for the the Vatreni (the \u2018Blazers\u2019)  Fabijanac calls the team \u2013 constructed with a blend of experience from the likes of Luka Modri\u0107, Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107 and Dejan Lovren with new faces such as Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol and Borna Sosa \u2013 as like a \u201cfamily.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve seen what\u2019s happened in this World Cup; Brazil have excellent players, Portugal have excellent players, Germany have excellent players but in my opinion, they have spirit and they don\u2019t have a team,\u201d Fabijanac told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. Croatia is too strong as a team.\u201d  From the rubble After the collapse of the Soviet Union, democratic movements swept across much of Eastern Europe, including Yugoslavia. With the election of non-communist governments in four of Yugoslavia\u2019s six republics, the Federation began to crumble and ethnic divisions resurfaced. By 1991, the prosperous Croatian republic sought to create a loose confederation or to dissolve the union entirely. Less wealthy Serbia opposed this. In June of 1991, Slovenia and Croatia declared independence. Fighting soon began as the Yugoslav army, consisting primarily of Serbs, tried to prevent Slovenia from establishing its own border posts. In July, fighting also broke out between Croatian forces and Serb militiamen.  Among the other republics, only the smallest \u2013 Montenegro \u2013 sided with Serbia. The two remaining republics, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia, voted in favor of independence. In 1992, the Serbian minority in Bosnia, helped by the federal army, attempted to carve out enclaves for itself, laying siege to Sarajevo. By the time the United Nations dismissed Yugoslavia from its General Assembly, some 20,000 people had died and up to two million had become refugees from fighting and \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d Back in 2018, Lovren recounted his memories of his escape as a young child from war-torn Bosnia in 1992. \u201cI just remember when the sirens went on,\u201d Lovren said. \u201cI was so scared because I was thinking \u2018bombs\u2019 or that something will happen now. \u201cI remember my mum took me and we went to the basement, I don\u2019t know how long we\u2019d been sitting there, I think it was until the sirens went off. Afterwards, I remember mum, my uncle, my uncle\u2019s wife, we took the car and then we were driving to Germany.\u201d Lovren\u2019s family settled in Germany, but after seven years they were told to leave and had to start life again in Croatia. Fabijanac admits while some of the squad were not even born during the bloody Balkan war, it is something which still hangs over the country, spurring its players on.  \u201cWe want to put the things which happened in the 1990s far from us,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere are sports, but we have very strong national emotions and this \u2026 is why the Croatian football players always play with the full heart for the national teams.  \u201cBecause we are a small country, we have a very, very ugly war which made many traumas for many people in Croatia. \u201cAnd sports and players in football and in other sports are national heroes. And that is the reason why they always play for the national teams one level higher than the highest. When we play for the national team in football, in any sport, we play with more than 100%, we play with 110%.  \u201cThey put their last atomic force on the field to do something for the country.\u201d   A new story The Croatian Football Association applied and gained admittance to soccer\u2019s world governing body FIFA, in 1992 and Europe\u2019s governing body UEFA in 1993.  \u201cWe have football in the blood. Every male child in Croatia wants to be a football player,\u201d Fabijanac said. \u201cFirst they learn how to walk, after that they take a football or something to play football.\u201d Fabijanac added: \u201cFor a small country like us, it\u2019s very important to have this fantastic national team because my granddaughter is three years old and she doesn\u2019t play with dolls, she plays with the ball and says only: \u2019 Modri\u0107, Modri\u0107, Modri\u0107.\u2019 That\u2019s something which is amazing.\u201d  It didn\u2019t take long for Croatia to make its mark on the international soccer stage. First, Croatia reached the quarterfinals of the 1996 Euros \u2013 beating a star-studded Denmark along the way.  Two years later, in its first ever World Cup appearance, Croatia got to the semifinals of the 1998 edition in France, eventually finishing third.  Thanks to its first golden generation of players \u2013 led by Davor \u0160uker and with Robert Prosine\u010dki and Zvonimir Boban adding a sprinkling off stardust \u2013 Croatia qualified with two wins from its group, then beating Romania and Germany in the knockout stages, before losing out to eventual-winners France in the semifinals.   \u0160uker finished as the 1998 tournament\u2019s top scorer and with its distinctive red and white kit as well as its propensity for shocking football\u2019s traditional heavyweights, Croatia became an immediate favorite for neutrals.  \u0160timac said that his former teammates and squad had the responsibility of laying down the foundations for Croatia\u2019s modern soccer heritage. \u201cOur generation was the one that we had the most difficult path because we were responsible to create a cult of Croatian culture in football and to make the road for the generations to come,\u201d \u0160timac told CNN.  \u201cAnd as a newly recognized country, it was obviously very difficult when you are such a small country in the football world and nobody appreciates to consider you at all as important part or subject.  \u201cAnd from that point of view, we had the most difficult situation and we did well and that\u2019s obviously helped generations which followed.\u201d  The arrival of Zlatko Dali\u0107 as Croatia\u2019s coach in 2017 has also proved pivotal.  Having been appointed after the team\u2019s qualification for the 2018 World Cup, Dali\u0107 came with pressure on his shoulders. With many of the team\u2019s star players in their prime \u2013 in particular, the midfielder three of Modri\u0107, Ivan Rakiti\u0107 and Marcelo Brozovi\u0107 \u2013 Croatia was expected to perform well.  Croatia did better than just perform well.  Thanks to the harmony Dali\u0107 was able to engender in the team, Croatia exceeded everyone\u2019s expectations by reaching the final \u2013 showing remarkable grit and resilience to win twice on penalties followed by an extra-time victory over England in the semifinals \u2013 before being overpowered by France in the final.  Returning to Croatia and a hero\u2019s welcome, with more than 500,000 fans turning Zagreb\u2019s streets into a tapestry of red and white to celebrate the players\u2019 success,  the team was feted for surpassing the so-called \u201cbronze\u201d generation of 1998.  \u201cIn the past, we also had very good teams. In 1998, we had much better players maybe in the time like Boban, \u0160uker, Prosine\u010dki, (Robert) Jarni, but maybe they don\u2019t share the chemistry between them to do what this team has done in the past few years,\u201d said Fabijanac.  \u201cWe only have one star, it\u2019s Luka Modri\u0107. The other players are not stars, like Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 or Cristiano Ronaldo or Neymar. But the rest of the team is a family and does the most important thing for us.  \u201cWhen Dali\u0107 came to be head coach, when he chose the team \u2026 he looked for characters.\u201d With Modri\u0107 at his magical best and goalkeper Dominik Livakovi\u0107 in imperious form and with the team able to seemingly pluck a goal out of thin air when needed, this Croatia side has continued to surprise, just like it did four years ago.  \u201cWhen we come to represent the national team, all the egos need to disappear,\u201d said Stimac.  \u201cThere is no place in the national team dressing room of Croatia for big egos, and everyone knows that. No one is bigger than the team, no one is bigger than the manager and that\u2019s what is taking us forward.\u201d Back in 1998, \u0160timac came off the bench to face Argentina and the likes of Gabriel Batistuta and Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n.  On Tuesday, Croatia will meet Lionel Messi and the next generation of Argentine stars knowing two wins stand between them and a new age of glory. "},

The European side has, once again, upset the odds to reach yet another World Cup semifinal after beating tournament favorite Brazil in the previous round and, make no mistake, Argentina will have its work cut out if its to reach the final. The Croats took a dazzling Brazil team into the trenches on Friday after scoring a last-gasp equalizer to force extra-time and eventually a penalty shootout, which it won thanks to more heroics from goalkeeper Dominik Livakovi\u0107. The Brazilians, who lit up the tournament with its attacking dynamism, were prevented from playing their entertaining style of football by a well-drilled Croatian team with a resolute defence.  Argentina and Messi will have to be ready for such a challenge but the team has already demonstrated its willingness to dig deep to find a way to win at Qatar 2022.  Messi and co. were also forced into penalties before winning its quarterfinal against the Netherlands on Friday in a full-bloodied match which showed the South Americans will be no pushovers.  However, the fiery encounter came at a cost with defenders Marcos Acuna and Gonzalo Montiel both suspended after picking up cautions in the quarterfinals. There are also still question marks around Angel Di Maria\u2019s fitness meaning Messi will have even more pressure on his shoulders to inspire his side to its first World Cup final since 2014.  The magician has been in fine form during the tournament, already scoring four goals, but it\u2019s also been his playmaking ability which has been so devastating.   The 35-year-old may not have the lightning speed he once possessed but his passing and vision have been nothing short of remarkable at the tournament. His no-look assist for Argentina\u2019s opening goal against the Netherlands, for example, was a moment of pure genius. Despite the threat he poses, Croatia won\u2019t become obsessed with stopping just one player, striker Bruno Petkovic says.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have a specific plan yet for stopping Messi and usually we don\u2019t concentrate on stopping one player but the entire team,\u201d Petkovic told reporters on Sunday.  \u201cWe will try to stop them as a team and not with man-marking. Argentina are not only Messi, they have a number of great players. We have to stop the entire Argentina team.\u201d   Croatia, meanwhile, will hope its veteran captain Luka Modri\u0107 can inspire the team to another final after it finished runner-up to France in 2018. The 37-year-old has rolled back the years in Qatar and has kept alive his team\u2019s hopes of another soccer miracle with a string of classy performances.  He\u2019s been helped out by fellow midfielders, Marcelo Brozovi\u0107 and Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107, which, as a unit, will test Argentina on Tuesday.  \u201cMateo, Luka and Marcelo are the best Croatia midfield in history. I don\u2019t think it can be repeated. When you pass them the ball it is safer than having your money in the bank,\u201d said defender Josip Juranovi\u0107, per Reuters.  According to data company Gracenote Sports, Argentina is now the favorite to lift the World Cup trophy. \u201cThe team\u2019s [Argentina] chance of emerging victorious is 41%. France\u2019s chance of successfully defending their 2018 World Cup title is 26%,\u201d said Gracenote. \u201cSurprise semi-finalists Morocco and Croatia have 17% and 16% chance respectively of becoming world champions.  \u201cThe most likely World Cup final out of the four remaining possibilities is Argentina v France which has a 37.5% chance of happening,\u201d added Gracenote.

The attacks struck a number of different locations, including a church being used as a base by Russian forces, according to the city\u2019s exiled mayor, Ivan Fedorov, who shared a video filmed at night of a fire burning in the distance.  \u201cFireworks in the east of Melitopol,\u201d he said in a post on social messaging app Telegram on Saturday, claiming that 200 people were killed and 300 injured in heavy shelling on the city.  In an interview with Ukrainian television a day later, Federov rowed back on that number, saying that \u201cdozens\u201d were dead. He added that three sites had been hit, including a restaurant-hotel complex on the outskirts of Melitopol, known as \u201cPrival Okhotnika,\u201d or Hunter\u2019s Rest, a checkpoint 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the city in Novobohdanivka, and a military unit that was \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d near the village of Semenivka.  Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-installed governor of Zaporizhzhia region, where Melitopol is located, said that Ukraine had hit Melitopol using a HIMARS system, killing two people and wounding 10 others, three of whom were treated in the hospital \u2013 a significantly lower number than was reported by Fedorov. \u201cUkrainian HIMARS were launched on the outskirts of Melitopol. Two missiles were shot down by anti-aircraft defense, but four reached their target,\u201d Balitsky said in a post on Telegram on Saturday, sharing a video of emergency services responding to a huge blaze. He claimed the targets had included a \u201crecreation center,\u201d where civilians and military personnel were having dinner on Saturday night, but did not name it. Fedorov claimed in an interview on Monday that Russian troops in the city were \u201cpanicking\u201d and \u201credeploying,\u201d given Ukrainian strikes on the city. Without providing any evidence, he said \u201cthey are busy moving their military groups to other places to try to hide them.\u201d Melitopol, a southeastern city on the banks of the Molochna River, fell to Moscow in March soon after the invasion. The city\u2019s mayor was abducted by Russian forces and later released, while a pro-Kremlin administration was installed.  Melitopol lies south of the city of Zaporizhzhia and to the east of Kherson city, which was recently recaptured by Ukrainian troops. It is a major Russian logistics hub and has been in Russian hands for several months, but has come under fire from Ukrainian counter-strikes in recent weeks.  Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, underlined the importance of the city in comments made to local media outlet Feigin Live on Saturday. \u201cIf Melitopol falls, the entire defense (of the occupiers) to Kherson collapses, the Ukrainian armed forces jump right to the border with Crimea on the isthmus,\u201d said Arestovych. The attacks on Melitopol came as the Ukrainians also struck a hotel, which allegedly housed the Wagner mercenary unit in Luhansk. Heavy artillery, including the use of Grad missiles, was also reported in southern Ukraine\u2019s Dnipropetrovsk region overnight, Valentyn Reznichenko, the head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration, said on Telegram Monday.  Power deficit after Russian drone strikes on Odesa Kyiv\u2019s attacks come as Russian strikes ramp up on Ukraine\u2019s power grid, and growing warnings of the energy crisis gripping the country. Across Ukraine, crews are scrambling to restore energy capabilities faster than Moscow\u2019s troops can knock them out. It\u2019s a difficult, and increasingly dire fight as a long winter sets in. All of Ukraine\u2019s thermal and hydroelectric power stations have been damaged in the relentless Russian missile strikes targeting the country\u2019s power system, Ukraine\u2019s prime minister said Sunday. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that \u201cthere is a significant [power] generation deficit\u201d in the country\u2019s energy system, following eight waves of Russian attacks targeting critical infrastructure.  \u201cAll thermal and hydroelectric power stations were damaged, and 40% of the high-voltage network facilities were damaged to varying degrees,\u201d said Shmyhal. \u201cEach of us must realize that this winter we will have to live through with significant restrictions on electricity consumption.\u201d Russian drone strikes on Odesa, a key port city in southern Ukraine, plunged more than 1.5 million people into darkness over the weekend. Power and water supplies were gradually being restored to the city, but 300,000 still remained without power on Sunday, Odesa Mayor Hennadii Trukhanov said in a statement on Telegram. \u201cThe situation is quite controlled, although not easy,\u201d he said, adding that his administration was re-launching pumping stations and delivering water by truck to zones where shortages continue.  President Zelensky said Sunday in his nightly address that the country\u2019s forces had shot down 10 of 15 drones that Russia deployed over Odesa \u2013 a number that could not be independently verified. He called the strikes by Russian drones \u201ccritical\u201d and suggested it would take a few days to restore the electricity supply in the region. \u201cThe power system is now, to put it mildly, very far from a normal state,\u201d he said. The port of Odesa is Ukraine\u2019s key to exporting vital food products, including through its \u201cGrain from Ukraine\u201d initiative, which is aimed at addressing the global hunger crisis. Ukrenergo, the Ukrainian state run energy provider, reported that there was still a \u201csignificant power deficit\u201d in the grid. \u201cThe situation in Odesa region is still difficult, the restoration of power supply to consumers continues,\u201d it said in a post on Facebook, adding that the destruction caused by Russian attacks \u201cdoes not allow to fully use the capacities of thermal power plants, additional time is needed to restore their work.\u201d"},

Here\u2019s what you need to know about the deadliest terrorist attack to have taken place in the United Kingdom. What happened? On December 21, 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 exploded 31,000 feet over Lockerbie, Scotland, 38 minutes after takeoff from London.  Two hundred and fifty-nine people on board the New York-bound Boeing 747 were killed, along with 11 people on the ground.   Witnesses in Lockerbie and the surrounding areas reported portions of the aircraft falling \u201cfrom the sky, some of which appeared to be engulfed in flames,\u201d according to a 2020 affidavit by a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) special agent, shared by the US Department of Justice.  \u201cAs pieces of the aircraft hit the ground, some exploded. One such incident created an explosion that witnesses likened to a \u201cmushroom cloud,\u201d and left a crater approximately 40 feet deep where, moments before, residential homes had stood in the town of Lockerbie,\u201d the agent said in the affadavit. A three-year investigation Afterward, United States and British investigators found fragments of a circuit board and a timer, and ruled that a bomb, not mechanical failure, caused the explosion. Over three years, investigators from the United States, Britain, Germany and other countries questioned more than 15,000 people in more than 30 countries and collected thousands of pieces of evidence.  Authorities accused Libyan nationals Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi and  Al Amin Khalifah Fhimah of manufacturing the bomb, which they said was made out of Semtex plastic explosives, concealed in a Toshiba cassette recorder, hidden in a Samsonite suitcase and slipped into an Air Malta flight headed from Malta to Frankfurt, Germany.  The unaccompanied bag is believed to have been transferred to a Pan Am flight to London and then to Flight 103. The CIA and FBI said the suspects, employed by Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta, were also Libyan intelligence agents. Libya versus the West Then-Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi denied any culpability for the attack.  But after Libya was sanctioned by the United Nations for initially refusing to hand over the suspects for trial to face trial, it was agreed that the pair would be prosecuted at a neutral site in the Netherlands.  In 2002 the suspects were handed over to the UN. The following year, Libya agreed to pay $2.7 billion in compensation to families of those killed \u2013 paving the way for UN sanctions against the country to be lifted.  Convicted terrorist later released on compassionate grounds The trial of Megrahi and Fhimah began on May 3, 2000, and ended on January 31, 2001. Megrahi was ultimately found guilty and jailed for a minimum of 27 years. Fhimah was found not guilty.  In October 2008 it was announced that Megrahi was suffering from terminal cancer, and in August 2009, he was released from a Scottish prison on compassionate grounds. After being released, Megrahi returned to Libya and received a jubilant welcome. He died on May 20, 2012. New suspect brought to trial In October 2015, Scottish officials announced that two additional Libyans had been identified as suspects in the bombing.  Five years later, on December 21, 2020,US Attorney General William Barr announced criminal charges against former Libyan intelligence officer Abu Agila Mohammad Mas\u2019ud Kheir Al-Marimi in relation to the Lockerbie attack.  The apparent break in the case came after Mas\u2019ud was arrested by Libyan authorities on another case. A 2012 Libyan interrogation report claiming he admitted to making the Lockerbie bomb had made its way to US authorities, and in 2020, the FBI traveled to Tunisia to interview the former Libyan official who had taken Mas\u2019ud\u2019s statement.  Mas\u2019ud has been charged in a criminal complaint for allegedly providing the suitcase with the prepared explosive that was later placed on the flight. At the time he was in custody in Libya. On Sunday, the US Justice Department said that Mas\u2019ud was in US custody. "},

You leave one room and a team of people suddenly appears to rearrange it back to its pristine condition.  \u201cIt\u2019s a global yacht. It\u2019s usually in the Mediterranean every summer,\u201d Chorbadzhiev said.  \u201cThen, in the winter, we can go to the Far East or places including the Seychelles, Maldives, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong or in the Gulf region like here.\u201d The yacht had recently been in Abu Dhabi for the Formula One grand prix, but was delayed in getting to Qatar due to reams of paperwork needed to obtain a visa to enter the country, according to Chorbadzhiev.   Superyachts vs. tents vs. portacabins  While moored in Abu Dhabi for the grand prix, the yacht played hosted people watching the race from its decks which looked over a portion of the track.   Now in Doha, guests can organize limousines ferrying them to World Cup stadiums for the tournament\u2019s games. Guests can also request to take the yacht out of the marina to view the city from afar.  According to BOAT Pro\u2019s Global Fleet Tracker, more than 20 superyachts have entered Qatari waters since the start of the tournament, including vessels such as Al Lusail and Alaiya, which are moored around Doha.  A superyacht World Cup stay offers something very different from some of the other accommodation available to guests in the city during the tournament.  From tents in the desert to portacabins on the edge of Doha, World Cup organizers have had to be innovative in providing accommodation options to fans with the influx of an estimated 1.5 million people staying in a nation smaller than Connecticut. CNN visited one of the fan villages as fans started arriving ahead of the tournament. "},

Its shock defeat to Japan on the opening day put the Germans in a difficult position, but it rallied in its second game against Spain to earn a hard-fought draw.  It means the 2014 world champion, which sits bottom of the group on one point, now needs to beat Costa Rica on Thursday and hope Spain beats Japan in order to progress into the knockout stages of the competition.  A draw in the group\u2019s other game could be enough for Germany but its fate would then depend on goal difference.  Speaking after the vital draw against Spain, Germany manager Hansi Flick said he hoped his team would gather some confidence for the crunch match at the Al Bayt Stadium after a more positive performance against Spain.  \u201cMaybe it is the spark we need,\u201d Flick said. \u201cThe team fought hard and I am very satisfied with their mentality. These are the things we want and we know that we did take the first step. \u201cWe want to have the conditions against Costa Rica to reach the knockout phase.\u201d    Group leader Spain, meanwhile, needs just a point against Japan to ensure progression into the round of 16 \u2013 it can even afford to lose the match depending on what happens in Germany\u2019s game with Costa Rica.  Spain coach Luis Enrique is determined for his side to enjoy their experience in Qatar and has defended his streaming sessions online in which he talks to fans.  \u201cThe only goal I set for my players \u2026 before this training camp 16 days ago, I told them we need to have fun, fun,\u201d he told reporters.  \u201cWe need to enjoy this because you have to have joy in your job.\u201d It\u2019s a philosophy that seems to be working; with Spain\u2019s young side producing impressive displays on the world stage.

They must believe in their team mates in order to fight against our opponent.

Belgium, Croatia and Morocco can all still qualify for the knockout rounds in what promises to be a fascinating round of matches.  Belgium and Croatia will play each other, while Morocco faces Canada \u2013 which is already out of the tournament.  Many Moroccans will still be recovering from an emotional victor against Belgium on Sunday, in what was the country\u2019s first World Cup win since 1998 \u2013 and its third ever. \u201cIf we get through to the knockout stage, I think we will be very dangerous going forward,\u201d Moroccan manager Walid Regragui told reporters earlier this week.    Anything other than a place in the round of 16 will be a major disappointment for both Belgium and Croatia.  The latter was the defeated finalist in 2018 and needs just a draw against Belgium to ensure progression through the group. But coach Zlatko Dalic says he refuses to entertain playing for anything but a win.  \u201cWe must not accept the option of having only one point to end the match with Belgium,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThere are no easy games. Belgium need a win but we will also aim for a win.\u201d Belgium, meanwhile, has struggled to find its feet in the tournament so far.  It was largely outplayed despite beating Canada its opening game and suffered a confidence-knocking defeat to Morocco the last time out.  However, coach Roberto Martinez says his team will be ready for the showdown and hopes his star players, such as Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, can turn its fortunes around.  \u201cWe have to stay together now and become stronger.

The individual was slightly injured and is being treated at hospital, while police are investigating, Spain\u2019s foreign ministry said.  Kyiv\u2019s ambassador to Spain, Serhil Pohoreltsev, was the intended recipient of the envelope, it added. A separate letter bomb, which was deactivated at a weapons manufacturer in northern Spain late Wednesday, had the same return address as the one that exploded in Ukraine\u2019s embassy in Madrid, a senior Spanish official told Spanish radio station SER.  \u201cThe return address on the envelope is an email that is the same\u201d on both envelopes, Rosa Serrano, the top Spanish government official in the Aragon region where the second bomb arrived, told SER. The explosive sent to the weapons maker in the city of Zaragoza, in Aragon, \u201capparently came from Ukraine,\u201d Serrano said, adding that authorities suspect the one at the embassy may have come from Ukraine, too. An executive at the arms manufacturer was apparently aware about the Madrid explosion, so when an envelope arrived soon after, that no one seemed to recognize, the company called the police, Serrano said. The bomb squad arrived, a security perimeter was established and police determined there were explosives inside the envelope, designed to explode upon opening. It was deactivated, Serrano said.  Serrano didn\u2019t identify the firm, but Spanish media reported its name and said it manufactures rocket launchers that Spain has sent to Ukraine to fight against Russia\u2019s invasion of that country. CNN could not immediately confirm that detail. \u201cI know the firm has been an arms manufacturer a long time, with state-of-the-art facilities,\u201d Serrano said in the radio interview.

Nikolenko said no one else had been injured, and that Kuleba \u201chas issued an urgent instruction to step up security at all Ukrainian embassies abroad\u201d following the incident. \u201cWhoever is behind this explosion they will not succeed in intimidating Ukrainian diplomats or stopping their daily work to strengthen Ukraine and to counter Russian aggression,\u201d Nikolenko quoted Kuleba as saying. Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Jose Manuel Albares spoke to Ambassador Pohoreltsev after the incident, Madrid said. The person injured was a Ukrainian worker, according to the statement. Spain, a NATO country, has sent military equipment to Ukraine to help its armed forces fight Russia\u2019s invasion.

The law proposes to ban all Russians from promoting or \u201cpraising\u201d homosexual relationships or publicly suggesting that they are \u201cnormal.\u201d It also prohibits \u201cpropaganda\u201d of pedophilia and gender reassignment in advertising, books, films.

The nation was eliminated from the tournament in Qatar after its 1-0 loss on Tuesday, ending a campaign that has been overshadowed by anti-government protests that have raged for months at home. But there are concerns about the safety of the Iranian players returning home across the Persian Gulf, after the team initially refused to sing Iran\u2019s national anthem before their first game in an apparent show of solidarity with demonstrators. The team\u2019s families were also threatened with imprisonment and torture in advance of the match, a source involved in the security of the games said. People in several Iranian cities celebrated from inside their homes and residential buildings moments after the final whistle, which came in the early hours of Wednesday local time, while videos posted on social media showed people honking their car horns, chanting and whistling.  \u201cI am happy, this is the government losing to the people,\u201d one witness to celebrations in a city in the Kurdish region, who CNN is not naming for security concerns, told CNN on Wednesday.  The Norway-based Iranian rights group Hengaw posted several videos of similar scenes. \u201cPeople in Paveh are celebrating Iran\u2019s national team lose over America in World Cup in Qatar, they are chanting \u2018Down with Jash (traitors),\u201d Hengaw said in a post. Demonstrations have rocked Iran for several months, sparking a deadly clampdown from authorities. The nationwide uprising was first ignited by the death of Mahsa (also known as Zhina) Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman who died in mid-September after being detained by the country\u2019s morality police. Since then, protesters across Iran have coalesced around a range of grievances with the regime.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Chief, Volker Turk, has said that the country is in a \u201cfull-fledged human rights crisis\u201d as authorities crack down on the protests.  Football has become an increasingly heated flashpoint in recent weeks, with the World Cup throwing a global spotlight on the turmoil inside the country.  And fans following the team in Qatar have become increasingly conflicted about their support. \u201cOur team has been hijacked,\u201d longtime fan Farshad Soheil told CNN. \u201cIt no longer represents the people of Iran.\u201d  Soheili said Iran\u2019s regime has managed to politicize and weaponize the team, and was critical of the players for not making a grander statement about the protests. \u201cIt was a wasted historical opportunity,\u201d Soheili said.  Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s game, many supporters said they didn\u2019t want Iran to win. \u201cThe reason is not because of football reason, [but] because of political reasons,\u201d another fan called Farshid \u2013 who withheld his last name for security reasons \u2013 told CNN in Doha. \u201cI have mixed emotion(s) and feeling(s),\u201d Farshid said. \u201cI\u2019m a passionate supporter of Iran but today unfortunately I can\u2019t be supporter of the national team because of the current situation going on and the government trying to hijack the game and sport and using it as a platform to buy credibility and to show that everything is normal (with) what\u2019s going on in Iran.\u201d Farshid said a lot of pro-regime supporters have also attended Iran\u2019s World Cup games in Doha and created a very tense environment for other Iranian fans by attempting to interfere with their interviews with the media. Concerns over returning players Iran\u2019s national side would have progressed to the second round of the World Cup with a win or draw against the US, but the team will now travel home after its group stage exit.  \u201cI\u2019m really sorry on behalf of our players, our group, that we couldn\u2019t get our opportunity to qualify for the next round,\u201d midfielder Saeid Ezatolah told reporters after the game. \u201cI hope our fans and our people in Iran, they forgive us. And I feel just sorry, that\u2019s it.\u201d The team\u2019s return will be closely watched amid fears that the players could face retribution for a perceived brief show of support for the protests, which drew international attention and praise from human rights groups.  The country\u2019s flag and national anthem have been rejected by protesters as symbols of the current regime. And, following the refusal of Iranian players to sing Iran\u2019s national anthem in their opening match against England on November 21, a source involved in the security of the games told CNN that the players were called to a meeting with members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).  The source said that they were told that their families would face \u201cviolence and torture\u201d if they did not sing the national anthem or if they joined any political protest against the Tehran regime. The players sang the anthem on Tuesday, and before their second game against Wales last Friday, which saw 2-0 victory for Iran. Hours before the game kicked off on Tuesday, Iranian authorities said a former member of the national soccer team, Parviz Boroumand \u2013 who was arrested this month over criticism of the government \u2013 was released on bail, according to state news agency IRNA. Boroumand had been arrested in mid-November during protests in Tehran, Iranian media outlets reported. Earlier on Tuesday, Iranian-Kurdish footballer Voria Ghafouri was also released on bail. Iranian football legend Ali Karimi, sometimes referred to as the \u201cAsian Maradona,\u201d has meanwhile said he has received death threats through his family members after he vocally supported protests.   The government has described him as one of the \u201cmain leaders\u201d of the demonstrations, and issued a warrant for his arrest in early October charging him with \u201charmonizing with the enemy\u201d and \u201cencouraging riots,\u201d according to Iran\u2019s Supreme Council of the Judiciary, both charges that are punishable by death.

In a comment to CNN, Marcelo M\u00e9ndez, Messi\u2019s representative, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a kick to the jersey or anything like that as everyone can see on the footage.  \u201cI believe there\u2019s literally no one who can even question once Leo\u2019s fair play through his career. He\u2019s one of the most honest footballers ever, never cheats, always respects rivals \u2026 I reckon this debate doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Messi\u2019s former Argentina teammate Sergio Ag\u00fcero responded to \u00c1lvarez initial message on Twitter, saying: \u201cMr. Canelo, don\u2019t look for excuses or problems, surely you don\u2019t know about football and what happens in a changing room.  \u201cThe shirts are always on the floor after games have finished due to sweat and then if you look properly, he makes the movement to remove his boot and accidentally hits it.\u201d Mexico captain Andr\u00e9s Guardado also came to Messi\u2019s defense, saying that \u201cunfortunately, perhaps Canelo does not understand what is experienced in a locker room.\u201d \u201cThat is why I can understand the reaction of being offended by seeing the Mexico shirt on the ground and everything that has gone viral,\u201d Guardado told Argentina\u2019s TyC Sports. \u201cBut to me, it seems silly that this is being talked about because it doesn\u2019t matter much.  \u201cFor me, I repeat, Leo has had made many gestures not only with me, with many colleagues who know what he is like and beyond what has been said, it is purely to generate controversy or sell things.\u201d \u201cEvery time I have had the opportunity to ask Messi for something, a change of shirt or a photo with my son, he has always done it.\u201d Argentina would go on to qualify top of its group after a 2-0 win over Poland \u2013 despite Messi missing a penalty in the match \u2013 while Mexico agonizingly failed to qualify for the knockout stage despite beating Saudi Arabia 2-1."},

But St\u00e9phanie Frappart\u2019s traditional anonymity has been broken for a different reason \u2013 she will make history on Thursday as the first woman to referee a men\u2019s World Cup match. Alongside assistants Neuza Back from Brazil and Karen Diaz from Mexico, the Frenchwoman will form part of an all-female refereeing trio officiating Costa Rica vs. Germany in their Group E match. Six female match officials have been officiating at this World Cup \u2013 referees Frappart, Rwanda\u2019s Salima Mukansanga and Japan\u2019s Yoshimi Yamashita as well as assistant referees Back, Diaz and Kathryn Nesbitt of the US.  FIFA announced their appointment back in May, when Frappart found out that she was going to the 2022 Qatar World Cup. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise, you cannot believe it and after two or three minutes, you realize that you are going to the World Cup. It\u2019s amazing, not only for me, but also for my family and also for the French referees,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. Throughout her career, Frappart has achieved a seemingly endless series of firsts. In 2019, she became the first female referee to take charge of a Ligue 1 match, in August 2019 the first to take charge of a major men\u2019s European match, and in 2020, the first to officiate a men\u2019s UEFA Champions League match. \u201cI knew that my life changed after 2019 because most people recognized me in the street,\u201d Frappart recalls.  \u201cSo I am like a role model, for women referees but I think it [also] inspired some women in society or in companies to take more and more responsibility.\u201d Already at this World Cup, Frappart has been the fourth official on two occasions \u2013 becoming the first female official at a men\u2019s World Cup match at Mexico vs. Poland. Mukasanga and Yamashita have also been the fourth official at two and four games of this World Cup respectively. But there is an obvious tension between these historic moments for gender equality in football and the place in which they are happening as women\u2019s rights are severely restricted in Qatar. According to Amnesty International, women remain tied to a male guardian in Qatar\u2013 usually their father, brother, grandfather, uncle or husband \u2013 and require their permission for important decisions such as marrying, accessing reproductive healthcare and working in many government jobs. CNN has reached out to the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) for comment but at the time of publication had not received a response. \u201cI was many times in Qatar \u2026 for the preparation of the World Cup, I was always welcomed in a good way. I don\u2019t know how life is there but I didn\u2019t make the decision to go there or to organize the World Cup,\u201d Frappart says.  \u201cSo now, 10 years after, it\u2019s difficult to say something, but I hope that \u2026 this World Cup will improve life for women there.\u201d  \u2018When you\u2019re a woman, you need to prove you have the quality\u2019 At the World Cup, on football\u2019s biggest stage, the pressure of refereeing a game is at its most intense. A referee might make 245 decisions in a single game, Sky Sports estimates, and if just one is wrong, it will be analyzed in microscopic detail.  It could alter the course of a game, or even a team\u2019s World Cup \u2013 denying it a title or ensuring it progresses no further in the tournament.  \u201cWhen you make a mistake, it\u2019s more important than if a player makes a mistake \u2013 there are more consequences for the teams,\u201d Frappart says. \u201cIt\u2019s also easy to say that it\u2019s the fault of the referee and not the fault of our team so when you lose.\u201d As referees work their way up to the highest echelons of the game, this pressure changes. \u201cIt\u2019s more from the media and [about] the money because you know that every decision is important and will make a difference for the team,\u201d Frappart says. \u201cBut when you start in the local clubs, it\u2019s more difficult with the spectators and with the environment.\u201d Inevitably, female referees are heavily scrutinized too as they straddle two traditionally male-dominated fields: football and leadership. \u201cThere were many questions involved if she\u2019s there because she\u2019s a woman, perhaps she will not follow the game and everything,\u201d Frappart recalls when she made her debut in Ligue 1.  \u201cIt\u2019s not only in football, but I think in every job when you\u2019re a woman \u2026 you need to prove that you have the quality and after that they let you continue.\u201d But as Frappart refereed more matches, the stance towards her changed. \u201cNow, it\u2019s not a question of gender. It\u2019s now only a question about steel, [about] competencies. So now it\u2019s ok, after one or two games, they left me alone and without any more media around.\u201d \u2018I worked hard\u2019 When Frappart first began playing football at ten years old in 1993, women\u2019s football barely registered as a significant landmark on the sporting landscape. The inaugural edition of the women\u2019s World Cup had been held just two years previously, with great success in China, but there was neither a women\u2019s Champions League in Europe nor a National Women\u2019s Soccer League (NWSL) in the USA and professional female referees were non-existent. It was only in 2017 when Bibiana Steinhaus took charge of a Bundesliga match that a woman officiated a top-level men\u2019s league match. Frappart\u2019s appointment as a referee at a men\u2019s World Cup is another step forward in a \u201cvery sexist sport,\u201d Costa Rica manager Luis Fernando said, according to Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to reach the point that she has reached, I think it\u2019s good for football and a positive step for football, to show that it\u2019s opening up for everyone,\u201d he added. Similarly, in Rwanda, Mukansanga recalls never seeing a female referee to use as a role model for her own aspirations. \u201cI worked hard and followed the men\u2019s dreams because they were the people surrounding me,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. \u201cThey\u2019re all men. We had one World Cup referee here in Rwanda who went to the World Cup twice so he inspired me a lot and I kept working hard to be like him.\u201d With women refereeing and the matches at the Qatar World Cup broadcast to huge audiences worldwide, Frappart hopes that it will encourage more women to pick up a whistle. Already this change is beginning to take place \u2013 in the UK alone, there was a 72% increase in qualified women referees between 2016 and 2020, according to the FA.  \u201cSo if you have more referees on the TV perhaps it might make it easier for women to say, okay, this is possible. Because if you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible for us, you cannot say: \u2018Okay, I want to be a referee.\u2019\u201d CNN\u2019s Alasdair Howorth contributed reporting."},

Having failed to qualify for the last World Cup, the tournament in Qatar is the first time since 2014 that the USMNT has reached the last 16, which comes courtesy of hard-fought draws against Wales and England before Tuesday\u2019s win against Iran.  The team is now setting its sights on loftier ambitions.  \u201cWe\u2019re not finished yet,\u201d defender Walker Zimmerman told CNN\u2019s This Morning on Wednesday. \u201cI think the narrative continues, we\u2019re still going to try and do that and accomplish our goal of winning the World Cup.  \u201cI think if we\u2019re able to do that, we\u2019re going to inspire a lot of young players, a lot of young Americans to pick up the sport and, hopefully, make them proud.\u201d The USMNT\u2019s best performance at a World Cup in recent memory was reaching the quarterfinals in 2002 before losing to Germany. Gregg Berhalter\u2019s side goes into Saturday\u2019s knockout game against the Netherlands as the underdog, eight places lower than its opponent in FIFA\u2019s world rankings.  But that\u2019s unlikely to shake the team\u2019s confidence. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to get to the next round, but we want to keep going,\u201d Berhalter told This Morning.  \u201cWe had two tournaments that we\u2019re looking at: the group stage tournament and the knockout tournament. And now, we\u2019re here in the knockouts, we just want to keep this thing rolling.\u201d Against Iran, star forward Christian Pulisic scored the only goal of the game before leaving the field with an abdominal injury.  Berhalter said Pulisic will \u201chopefully\u201d be fit to play against the Netherlands and praised the Chelsea player\u2019s talent and work ethic.  Speaking on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America, USMNT captain Tyler Adams said Pulisic had \u201cput it all on the line.\u201d  \u201cHe\u2019s doing alright, he\u2019s in great spirits,\u201d Adams added. \u201cFeeling a lot better now, but what a big player for us, showing up in the biggest moments. We rely on him a lot for the big moments.\u201d Much of the buildup to Tuesday\u2019s game between the US and Iran focused on the political tensions between the two nations.  Iran state media called for the US to be kicked out of the tournament after US Soccer changed Iran\u2019s flag on its social media accounts to show support for the protestors in Iran. The governing body told CNN that it wanted to change the official flag for 24 hours to show \u201csupport for the women in Iran fighting for basic human rights\u201d but always planned to go back to the original flag. Iran appeared at the World Cup under the shadow of domestic turmoil following widespread protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died after being detained by Iran\u2019s morality police, allegedly for not abiding by the country\u2019s conservative dress code. Iranian security forces have since unleashed a violent response to the protests. There are concerns about the safety of the Iranian players returning home after the team initially refused to sing Iran\u2019s national anthem before its first game in an apparent show of solidarity with demonstrators. The team\u2019s families were also threatened with imprisonment and torture in advance of the match, a source involved in the security of the games said. At the end Tuesday\u2019s game, players from the two teams embraced in an apparent show of solidarity.  US defender Antonee Robinson was seen embracing a visibly distraught Ramin Rezaeian, who cried as he was embraced by the Fulham player, and comforting Abolfazl Jalali, who knelt on the pitch after the match ended.  Meanwhile, Josh Sargent, DeAndre Yedlin and Timothy Weah crouched to comfort Saeid Ezatolahi, who had buried his head in his hands as he sat on the turf and processed his team\u2019s loss.  \u201cWe know first and foremost as competitors what it\u2019s like to lose,\u201d said Zimmerman. \u201cWe also know the stakes of a World Cup, and then on top of that everything that they\u2019re dealing with emotionally.  \u201cWe just congratulated them on their effort and empathized with them and let them know that we\u2019re proud of the way that they competed on the field in the game last night.\u201d CNN\u2019s Matt Foster, Issy Ronald and Sam Kiley contributed to reporting.

In just 31 minutes on the court, the shooting guard shot 20-for-25 from the field and went 6-for-7 from deep, making it one of the most efficient scoring performances in NBA history. According to ESPN Stats and Info, he became only the second player in the last 25 years to score 50 points with 80% shooting accuracy in the first three quarters of a game along with James Harden in November 2017. \u201cIt felt like a double-sized rim out there,\u201d Booker said after the game. \u201cIf I rise up, it\u2019s going in.\u201d The 26-year-old guard and center Deandre Ayton \u2013 who finished with 30 points and 14 rebounds \u2013 dominated the first half, combining for 41 points and giving the Suns a 21-point halftime lead.  In the third, Booker took it to another gear, dropping 26 points to kill the game off \u2013 shooting 10-for-11 in the quarter.  Booker was on fire despite the Bulls\u2019 best efforts, ending the third quarter with a run of nine consecutive points including a dunk, a 29-foot triple and a four-point play. After he had won the game for the Suns in the third quarter, Booker was pulled for the rest of the game, but he did apparently have the option to keep piling up the points. \u201cCoach [Monty Williams] tried to put me in when they cut it to 18 \u2026 I didn\u2019t think it was necessary,\u201d Booker said after the game. Suns coach Williams said, \u201cThere\u2019s not a level where he can\u2019t score. \u201cHe can use both hands, he can score with a hand in his face and he\u2019s willing to take the tough shots.\u201d Bulls guard Zach LaVine, who finished with 21 points and seven assists, agreed, \u201cA guy like that gets in a rhythm and it\u2019s too late. He gets it going and it\u2019s over.\u201d Booker now has back-to-back 40-point games after scoring 44 against the Sacramento Kings and is making his case as an early MVP candidate. The win takes the Suns to the top of the Western Conference at 15-6, a record bolstered by a 12-1 tally at home. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many sellout crowds that is in a row, but it\u2019s impressive,\u201d Booker said on the support in the Footprint Center.  \u201cMondays, Tuesdays, Saturdays, it doesn\u2019t matter what day of the week it is. They show up and show out.\u201d But much of that success is down to Booker, who in this game took advantage of slack Bulls\u2019 defending to continue his hot streak and is now averaging just under 28 points per game. \u201cWe threw everything at him,\u201d Bulls coach Billy Donovan said on Booker. \u201cWe trapped him, we threw a box and one at him. We tried to face guard him and to his credit had had a great night.\u201d Fans were chanting, \u201cMVP! MVP!\u201d after Booker sunk a three-pointer in the third quarter. It might be a bit too early for that, but if Booker keeps on racking up numbers like he did tonight, he will become hard to ignore as the season progresses."},

The guest, Ngozi Fulani, is the CEO of Sistah Space, an organization that provides specialist services to women of African and Caribbean heritage affected by abuse.  Fulani was attending a royal function on domestic abuse organized by the Queen Consort on Tuesday evening when she said a member of staff began a line of questioning that the palace called \u201cunacceptable and deeply regrettable.\u201d Fulani said that the person persistently asked about her heritage and would not accept that she was a British national. Sistah Space shared a rough transcript of the conversation on Twitter on Wednesday. Fulani said that, after identifying herself as British-born, the person asked her \u201cwhere do you really come from;\u201d \u201cwhere do your people come from;\u201d and \u201cwhen did you first come here?\u201d  When Fulani answered she was from the London neighborhood of Hackney, the household member insisted: \u201cNo, what part of Africa are YOU from?\u201d as quoted on the Sistah Space twitter account. Buckingham Palace, which has not named the household member involved in the incident, said earlier today that the individual concerned had apologized and \u201cstepped aside from her honorary role with immediate effect.\u201d  Sistah Space said that it \u201cserves no purpose to name & shame\u201d the person in question on its Twitter account on Wednesday, adding \u201cit is the system that needs to be revised.\u201d  \u201cYes the person was offensive, but it serves no purpose to name & shame her, it would make us just as bad. We prefer that this be handled kindly,\u201d Sistah Space said. British media have identified the Buckingham Palace official as Lady Susan Hussey, who served as the late Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s lady in waiting for more than 60 years and is a godmother to the Prince of Wales. CNN has reached out to Ngozi Fulani and Buckingham Palace for further comment from the household member in question.  A Buckingham Palace spokesperson acknowledged the incident and said the palace was taking the situation \u201cextremely seriously.\u201d \u201cUnacceptable and deeply regrettable comments have been made. We have reached out to Ngozi Fulani on this matter, and are inviting her to discuss all elements of her experience in person if she wishes,\u201d the spokesperson said.  \u201cIn the meantime, the individual concerned would like to express her profound apologies for the hurt caused and has stepped aside from her honorary role with immediate effect.\u201d News of the encounter came to light as the Prince and Princess of Wales traveled to the US ahead of the second iteration of the Earthshot Prize Awards later this week. A spokesman for William said: \u201cRacism has no place in our society, these comments were unacceptable. It\u2019s right that the individual concerned has stepped down.\u201d The incident is likely to revive concerns that the palace is elitist and out of touch when it comes to issues of race and identity. The palace has, in recent years, faced allegations of racist behavior, including in its hiring practices decades ago and the treatment of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. A former counterterrorism police chief said Tuesday that Meghan and Harry had faced \u201cdisgusting and very real\u201d threats from right-wing extremists.  Meghan claimed in an interview with Oprah Winfrey last year that an unnamed member of the family made remarks about the skin color of their unborn baby while she was pregnant with Archie. Prince William later said the royal family was \u201cvery much not a racist family.\u201d Sign up for CNN\u2019s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what\u2019s happening behind palace walls."},

Alexis Mac Allister\u2019s scuffed effort 60 seconds into the second half broke the deadlock before Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez\u2019s brilliant curled shot sealed the three points as Argentina advanced as Group C winners.  The opener came after Messi, Argentina\u2019s all-time top goalscorer, had his penalty saved by Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny.  \u00c1lvarez\u2019s sublime finish midway through the second half capped off a nail-biting evening for Argentina, who will now face Australia. Poland advanced to the knockout stages by the skin of its teeth, qualifying on goal difference.  The other Group C game was a thrilling affair, Mexico beating Saudi Arabia 2-1, but the win wasn\u2019t enough for El Tri and Poland will now play France in a last-16 match on Sunday.  An enthralling evening Not for the first time in his career, all the pressure laid firmly at Messi\u2019s door, the 35-year-old endlessly striving to emerge from the long shadow which Diego Maradona has cast over the Argentina national side.  Playing in his 999th professional match, Messi looked up for the challenge, troubling Poland from the opening minute.  While the Polish attack offered very little throughout the game, Argentina cranked up the pressure \u2013 and both Messi and left-back Marcos Acu\u00f1a coming close.  Argentina was offered a great chance to break the deadlock when the video assistant referee adjudged that Messi had been fouled by Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny when he was hit in the face by the Polish goalkeeper\u2019s flailing hand.  However, Messi\u2019s penalty was brilliantly saved by Szcz\u0119sny\u2019s who somehow beat the ball away one-handed.  It was the crowning moment of a busy first half for Szcz\u0119sny, who finished the opening 45 minutes with nine saves to his name as Argentina piled on the pressure.  The penalty save was Szcz\u0119sny\u2019s second of the tournament already and he became only the second goalkeeper since 1966 to save a penalty at the World Cup having conceding it himself, after Joel Bats for France against Brazil in 1986, according to Opta Stats.  It took just under 60 seconds for Argentina to break the deadlock after the break.  A cut back cross from right back Nahuel Molina fell to the feet of Mac Allister whose scuffed effort just managed to sneak past Szcz\u0119sny and send Stadium 974 into delirium.  It was Mac Allister\u2019s first international goal, and continues his excellent year \u2013  he came to this World Cup as the top scorer for his Premier League club, Brighton and Hove Albion, this season.  That goal seemed to relax the Argentina players and fans inside the ground. Messi, \u00c1lvarez and \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda began to turn on the flair, toying with the Poland defense.  Midway through the second half, \u00c1lvarez showed why he\u2019d been brought in for this game \u2013 he\u2019d started the first two group games on the bench \u2013 curling home to get his first World Cup goal.  With Poland opening up at it attempted to claw itself back in the game, more spaces opened up for Argentina, with Messi, \u00c1lvarez and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez all going close. Group C\u2019s conclusion must have been an agonizing watch for Poland\u2019s fans. For a brief period of time during the match, Poland and Mexico were tied on goal difference. That meant Poland was slated to advance via its better disciplinary record.  With Poland fans checking their phones furiously to keep tabs on proceedings and with all eyes on whether any Polish players picked up a yellow card, there was one last twist to Wednesday\u2019s proceedings. That was delivered by Salem Al Dawsari\u2019s 95th-minute goal which gave Poland had a superior goal difference, assuring it\u2019s progression to the next stage."},

Hakimi was born in Madrid and the the weight of Africa and the Arab world on his shoulders, but you would never have guessed as the Paris Saint-Germain coolly clipped the ball into the net and set off wild celebrations not just in the stadium, but also in Morocco and for the Moroccan diaspora. This was a historic day for Morocco, for Africa, for Arabs and for Muslims. The Atlas Lions had roared to stun 2010 World Cup winner Spain and reach the quarterfinals of Qatar 2022. The significance of the occasion was not lost on head coach Walid Regragui. \u201cBefore it was just the Moroccans who supported us,\u201d he said ahead of the game against Spain. \u201cNow it is the Africans and Arabs.\u201d For many, it was the shock of the tournament, as the North Africans won their first ever knockout game at a World Cup.  On Saturday, Morocco went one better, beating Portugal 1-0 in the quarterfinals to become the first African team to reach a World Cup semifinal. Youssef En-Nesyri netted the only goal of the match ijust before half time with a spectacular header to score the first ever knockout stage goal in the nation\u2019s history. But how did Morocco get to the final four of the most prestigious competition in world football? Return of Morocco\u2019s chosen son Many eyebrows were raised when the Moroccan Federation made the decision to sack Vahid Halilhod\u017ei\u0107 in August, just over three months ahead of the World Cup after the Bosnian coach had guided the team through qualifying to Qatar 2022. But for those in Morocco, it was instead the heir to the Moroccan coaching throne simply taking his place at the perfect time. Affectionately nicknamed \u201cRass l\u2019Avocat\u201d (Avocado Head) because of his bald head, Regragui was a hard-tackling defender who, despite being born in France, chose to represent the nation of his family, notching up 45 caps. Since becoming a coach, Regragui has enjoyed success everywhere he has been, leading a mid-table Moroccan club FUS Rabat to their only ever league title.  He had a brief stint in Qatar where he won the league with Al Duhail SC, before moving back to Morocco where he led Wydad Cassablanca to a league and Champions League double earlier this year. It was a matter of when, not if he would take charge of the national team. Many Moroccans thought that it could be after the World Cup or in a few years, but none were unhappy when it was announced he would take over the national side less than 100 days before their first game at the World Cup. In African football, Regragui has often been compared with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho thanks to his tactical discipline and stellar man-management skills. Both of those have been present in the World Cup. Morocco has played more than 400 minutes of football at the tournament and negotiated a penalty shootout, and yet the Atlas Lions have conceded just once \u2013 and that was an unfortunate own goal against Canada in the team\u2019s final Goup F match. After the dramatic shootout win against Spain, video circulated on social media of Regragui running to the stands and hugging and kissing his mother who was in the crowd. Regragui is a French-born Moroccan. He has assembled the most nationally diverse team at the World Cup \u2013 14 of the 26 players were born outside of Morocco from six different countries \u2013 and has seamlessly integrated this group players from around the world into one coherent unit. World Cup tournaments can be tough emotionally to navigate \u2013 players are away from home for weeks \u2013 but Regragui has counteracted that by allowing the players\u2019 families to stay with the team in camp in Qatar.  As with that of emotional video of Regragui embracing his mother, one of the most heartwarming photos of the World Cup was Hakimi kissing his mother after Morocco\u2019s victory against Spain.  It\u2019s not only the players who have had their families with them. Regragui himself was filmed going to the stands to visit his mother Fatima who told Morocco broadcaster Arriyadia how much it meant to her. \u201cDuring his whole career as a player and as a coach, I never traveled to watch him,\u201d Fatima said. \u201cI\u2019ve been living in France for more than 50 years now and this is the first competition that I left Paris for.\u201d A Federation taking football seriously The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FMRF) should also be credited with the Atlas Lions\u2019 success at Qatar 2022. After decades of footballing mediocrity, the FMRF \u2013 with the backing of King Mohammed VI \u2013 decided to overhaul the nation\u2019s football structure. In 2009 the FMRF opened its national football academy, the Mohamed VI Football Academy \u2013 which helped develop current international players like Nayef Aguerd and Youssef En-Nesryi \u2013 as well as trying to unearth talent in the Moroccan diaspora by employing scouts from across Europe to flag any eligible youth players in Europe. The federation also began investing in women\u2019s football, developing football in schools and clubs as well as a creating a national league structure. Funded by the FMRF, Morocco is currently the only nation in the world to have two tiers of women\u2019s football that are both fully professional.  The crown jewel of Morocco\u2019s football investment is the Mohamed VI Football Complex just outside Rabat. The training complex contains four five-star hotels, eight FIFA standard pitches \u2013 one of which is indoor in a climate-controled building \u2013 as well a medical facility that includes a dentist. That investment over the last decade has begun to pay off. For the first time in history, Moroccan clubs are the holders of the men\u2019s and women\u2019s African Champions League titles as well the men\u2019s Confederations Cup \u2013 Africa\u2019s Europa League. Morocco is also the African Nations Championship champion \u2013 a continental tournament where nations put out teams exclusively featuring players who play domestically \u2013 while the women\u2019s team came second in the Women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year and qualified for its first World Cup. Morocco\u2019s success at the World Cup may be best story of the tournament so far, but it is not the not the result of luck and grit, but rather expertise and planning."},

Youssef En-Nesyri scored the game\u2019s only goal, rising highest to head the ball into the net just minutes before halftime, while Morocco\u2019s defense once again kept a clean sheet. The Atlas Lions have become one of the stories of the tournament, holding fellow semifinalist Croatia to a draw in the group stage, and defeating Belgium, Spain and now Portugal on their way to a semifinal.  \u201cBefore it was just the Moroccans who supported us, now it is the Africans and Arabs,\u201d manager Walid Regragui said before the quarterfinal, referencing the electric atmosphere that has accompanied his team at every game. And the Al Thumama Stadium rang with cheers, drums and whistles on Saturday as if almost an entire continent and region were inside, witnessing their team make history. Defeat for Portugal marked the end of what is likely to be Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s last World Cup as even he could not make a dent in the Morocco defense and was left in tears walking down the tunnel after the final whistle. The Atlas Lions, meanwhile, launched Regragui into the air in their now trademark victory celebration.  The last time these two teams met, at the 2018 World Cup,  Ronaldo scored the game\u2019s only goal. This time around Ronaldo started on the bench for the second consecutive match. Both teams began brightly, with Portugal dominating possession but unable to breakdown the well-organized Morocco defense which has conceded just one goal during Qatar 2022. Two attempts from Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix offered the only real Portuguese threat in the opening 30 minutes \u2013 the first, a powerful, accurate header forcing goalkeeper Yassine \u201cBono\u201d Bounou into action and the second, a strike that deflected off two players, ricocheting wildly, but landing on top of the netting. Instead, it was Morocco who got the breakthrough three minutes before halftime as Yahia Attiyat-Allah floated the ball perfectly into the box and En-Nesyri rose highest, far above goalkeeper Diogo Costa and R\u00faben Dias, to head it into the net. Ronaldo entered the fray just after the break for his 196th international appearance, becoming the joint most-capped men\u2019s player of all time. But even he could not stamp his authority on the game as Portugal remained stranded outside the box for much of the second half, held in place by a defiant Moroccan defense.  Any shots that did make it past the front lines of defense were marshalled by Bounou who plucked a powerful Bruno Fernandes strike out of the air and minutes later tipped Felix\u2019s effort over the crossbar with his outstretched hand.  As regular time ticked into eight minutes of stoppage time, Ronaldo also had a chance to equalize but his low shot was once again saved by Bounou.  Coaches, support staff and players from both sides tensely prowled the sidelines as the game opened up in its closing minutes. Walid Cheddira was red carded for two yellow cards in as many minutes leaving his team to defend its slender lead with just 10 men for the last six minutes.  Zakaria Aboukhlal broke free on the counterattack and only had to round Costa to seal Morocco\u2019s victory but was unable to do so, while Pepe\u2019s header for Portugal in front of the goal glanced just wide.  Ultimately, however, Morocco held on for a deserved and famous victory that will be remembered for years to come."},

Feeling pretty hairy, bad,\u201d Wahl told co-host Chris Wittyngham in the episode. He added that he sought help at the medical clinic at the World Cup media center, believing he had bronchitis.

He\u2019d had a cold for 10 days, which \u201cturned into something more severe,\u201d he wrote, adding that he felt better after receiving antibiotics and catching up on sleep. Wahl had made headlines in November by reporting that he was detained and briefly refused entry to a World Cup match because he was wearing a rainbow t-shirt in support of LGBTQ rights. He said security staff had told him to change his shirt because \u201cit\u2019s not allowed,\u201d and had taken his phone. Wahl said he was released 25 minutes after being detained and received apologies from a FIFA representative and a senior member of the security team at the stadium. Afterward, Wahl told CNN he \u201cprobably will\u201d wear the shirt again."},

One man wearing the red and green of Morocco\u2019s national flag and its football kit raised his hands in supplication as the final minutes ticked away, shouting \u201cO God, o God.\u201d In the media box, a security guard, screaming with triumph, hugged a Moroccan journalist who was weeping with happiness. As Moroccan player Jawad El Yamiq circled the pitch with a flag draped around his shoulders, one fan stood motionless, looking out over the pitch with his hands over his mouth as if unable to take in the scale of the win. But in Rabat, joyful fans thronged the streets, people poured towards the downtown square where Morocco\u2019s victories are celebrated. \u201cThe last few minutes felt like hours,\u201d said one fan, Samir Saqri, as he joined a crowd pouring out from the cafe where they had watched the game to head downtown. \u201cMorocco is showing that African teams can compete at a high level,\u201d he added."},

In his acceptance speech, Williams hailed the three other finalists and credited his parents, teammates and coaches for him being able to win the award.  \u201cIf you are willing to put in the work and surround yourself with positive people, you can achieve anything,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI used to write down my goals in a journal and what used to just be words on a piece of paper, has me standing here today.

Former Trojan running back Reggie Bush won the award in 2005 but was stripped of it after an NCAA investigation found Bush received impermissible benefits, including several thousand dollars and a vehicle while in school.  Last year, after the NCAA approved a new policy for student athletes to make money on their names, images and likeness, they said Bush will not get the trophy back. Williams\u2019 Heisman award caps off a season in which USC ended up just short of the College Football Playoff. Williams suffered a hamstring injury in the Trojans\u2019 loss to the University of Utah in the Pac-12 championship game last week. It\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019ll play in the team\u2019s January 2 game against Tulane in the Cotton Bowl at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. "},

He was 49. He \u201ccollapsed\u201d while covering Friday\u2019s Argentina-Netherlands match, a witness told CNN. Qatar\u2019s World Cup organizers said on Saturday that Wahl \u201cfell ill\u201d in the press area, where he received \u201cimmediate medical treatment on site.\u201d He was then transferred to Hamad General Hospital, said a spokesperson for the Supreme Court Committee for Delivery and Legacy, the body responsible for planning the tournament.  He was treated in the stadium \u201cfor about 20-25 minutes\u201d before he was moved to the hospital, Keir Radnedge, a columnist at World Soccer Magazine, told CNN Saturday. \u201cThis was towards the end of extra time in the match. Suddenly, colleagues up to my left started shouting for medical assistance. Obviously, someone had collapsed. Because the chairs are freestanding, people were able to move the chairs, so it\u2019s possible to create a little bit of space around him,\u201d Radnedge said. He added that the medical team were there \u201cpretty quickly and were able to, as best they could, give treatment.\u201d The circumstances around his death are not clear. \u201cThe entire US Soccer family is heartbroken to learn that we have lost Grant Wahl,\u201d US Soccer said in a statement on its official Twitter account. \u201cGrant made soccer his life\u2019s work, and we are devastated that he and his brilliant writing will no longer be with us.\u201d US Soccer praised Wahl\u2019s passion and \u201cbelief in the power of the game to advance human rights,\u201d and shared its condolences with Wahl\u2019s wife, Celine Gounder, and his loved ones. Gounder also posted the US Soccer statement on Twitter. \u201cI am so thankful for the support of my husband Grant Wahl\u2019s soccer family and of so many friends who\u2019ve reached out tonight. I\u2019m in complete shock,\u201d wrote Gounder, a former CNN contributor who served on the Biden-Harris transition Covid-19 advisory board. US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the department was in \u201cclose communication\u201d with Wahl\u2019s family. The World Cup organizers also said they were in touch with the US embassy \u201cto ensure the process of repatriating the body is in accordance with the family\u2019s wishes.\u201d  Wahl had covered soccer for more than two decades, including 11 World Cups \u2014 six men\u2019s, five women\u2019s \u2013 and authored several books on the sport, according to his website.  He had just celebrated his birthday earlier this week with \u201ca great group of media friends at the World Cup,\u201d according to a post on his official Twitter account, which added: \u201cVery thankful for everyone.\u201d Feeling ill In an episode of the podcast Futbol with Grant Wahl, published days before his death on December 6, he had complained of feeling unwell. \u201cIt had gotten pretty bad in terms of like the tightness in my chest, tightness, pressure. Feeling pretty hairy, bad,\u201d Wahl told co-host Chris Wittyngham in the episode. He added that he sought help at the medical clinic at the World Cup media center, believing he had bronchitis.  He was given cough syrup and ibuprofen, and felt better shortly afterward, he said. Wahl also said he experienced an \u201cinvoluntary capitulation by my body and mind\u201d after the US-Netherlands game on December 3. \u201cThis isn\u2019t my first rodeo. I\u2019ve done eight of these on the men\u2019s side,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cAnd so like, I\u2019ve gotten sick to some extent at every tournament, and it\u2019s just about trying to find a way to like get your work done.\u201d He further described the incident in a recent newsletter published on December 5, writing that his body had \u201cbroke down\u201d after he had little sleep, high stress and a heavy workload. He\u2019d had a cold for 10 days, which \u201cturned into something more severe,\u201d he wrote, adding that he felt better after receiving antibiotics and catching up on sleep. Wahl had made headlines in November by reporting that he was detained and briefly refused entry to a World Cup match because he was wearing a rainbow t-shirt in support of LGBTQ rights. He said security staff had told him to change his shirt because \u201cit\u2019s not allowed,\u201d and had taken his phone. Wahl said he was released 25 minutes after being detained and received apologies from a FIFA representative and a senior member of the security team at the stadium. Afterward, Wahl told CNN he \u201cprobably will\u201d wear the shirt again. Tributes pour in Wahl\u2019s death has sent shockwaves through the soccer and sports journalism community, with many sharing tributes on social media. \u201cOnly some days ago, Grant was recognized by FIFA and AIPS (the International Sports Press Association) for his contribution to reporting on eight consecutive FIFA World Cups,\u201d said FIFA President Gianni Infantino in a statement. Infantino and FIFA media director Bryan Swanson were at the hospital on Saturday to offer any kind of support needed for the family, friends, and the journalists who were also his housemates in Qatar.  The co-editors in chief of Sports Illustrated, the publication where Wahl spent the majority of his career, said in a joint statement they were \u201cshocked and devastated at the news of Grant\u2019s passing.\u201d  \u201cWe were proud to call him a colleague and friend for two decades \u2013 no writer in the history of (Sports Illustrated) has been more passionate about the sport he loved and the stories he wanted to tell,\u201d said the statement. It added that Wahl had first joined the publication in November 1996. He had volunteered to cover the sport as a junior reporter \u2013 back before it reached the heights of global popularity it now enjoys \u2013 eventually becoming \u201cone of the most respected soccer authorities in the world,\u201d it said. The statement said that Wahl also worked with other media outlets including Fox Sports. After leaving Sports Illustrated in 2020, he began publishing his podcast and newsletter.  On Friday in Philadelphia, basketball star LeBron James said he had been \u201cvery fond of Grant.\u201d While Wahl was at Sports Illustrated, he did a cover story on James when James was in high school. \u201cI\u2019ve always kind of watched from a distance even when I moved up in ranks and became a professional, and he went to a different sport,\u201d said James, speaking at a postgame press conference. \u201cAny time his name would come up I\u2019ll always think back to me as a teenager and having Grant in our building \u2026 It\u2019s a tragic loss.\u201d  Tennis great Billie Jean King said the American\u2019s death was \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d \u201cA talented journalist, Grant was an advocate for the LGBTQ community & a prominent voice for women\u2019s soccer,\u201d King tweeted Saturday. \u201cHe used his platform to elevate those whose stories needed telling. Prayers for his family.\u201d Other current and former US soccer players, including Ali Krieger and Tony Meola, shared their condolences, as did sporting bodies such as Major League Soccer and the National Women\u2019s Soccer League. Wittyngham, Wahl\u2019s podcast co-host, told CNN on Saturday the news of his death had been hard to fathom. \u201cFor Americans, Grant Wahl is the first person you read covering soccer. He was kind of the only person for a while \u2026 Grant was the first person who really paid genuine attention to this sport in a meaningful way,\u201d Wittyngham said. Several journalists shared stories of reporting alongside Wahl, and having encountered him at multiple World Cups over the years. \u201cBefore he became the best covering soccer he did hoops and was so kind to me,\u201d wrote famed broadcaster Dick Vitale. Timmy T. Davis, the US Ambassador to Qatar, tweeted that Wahl was \u201ca well known and greatly respected reporter who focused on the beautiful game.\u201d"},

It\u2019s likely Ronaldo\u2019s final appearance at a World Cup as he began Portugal\u2019s round of 16 and quarterfinal games as a substitute after being benched by the team\u2019s coach Fernando Santos.   Ronaldo was brought on early in the second half of Saturday\u2019s match, but to no avail as Portugal was beaten by the Atlas Lions thanks to Youssef En-Nesyri\u2019s first-half header. Ronaldo\u2019s appearance was the 196th of his Portugal career equaling Bader Al-Mutawa of Kuwait for the most caps in men\u2019s international football history. If it is to be Ronaldo\u2019s final appearance at a World Cup, he has certainly made his mark on the tournament over the years.  In his 22 games at the finals, Ronaldo scored eight goals and earlier in this year\u2019s tournament, the 37-year-old became the first men\u2019s player to score in five World Cups.  However, his benching by Santos and his recent contract termination from Manchester United, which was announced just after the World Cup started, arguably overshadowed Ronaldo\u2019s time at Qatar 2022 in a tournament where he scored just one goal."},

Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni gave France a first-half lead, his powerful shot setting the game ablaze at the Al Bayt Stadium on Saturday.  England grew into the game and team captain Harry Kane emphatically converted from the penalty spot to draw the 2018 semifinalists level. The goal was his 53rd for his country, drawing him level with Wayne Rooney as England\u2019s all-time top scorer. With just over 10 minutes remaining, Olivier Giroud\u2019s header gave the reigning champion the lead once again, with Kane skying a late penalty as France was able to hold onto victory.  France will face Morocco in the semifinals on Wednesday after it beat Portugal earlier in the day to become the first ever team from Africa to reach this stage of the World Cup. The French victory ensured Didier Deschamps\u2019 team is the first defending champion to have progressed past the quarterfinals this century. Giroud called France\u2019s performance \u201camazing.\u201d \u201cAt the end of the game on our last chances, we knew how to be dangerous. I knew I was going to have another chance and Grizi gave me a great pass,\u201d Giroud told the French Football Federation\u2019s website, referring to Antoine Griezmann, who set up France\u2019s winning goal with a superb cross. \u201cTonight, it was a great match, we know the talent of this young English generation, we made a very solid match, we tried to be powerful in our counterattacks.\u201d  A clash of titans It was a match between two out of the final four teams at the 2018 World Cup, with both nations seen as heavyweight contenders to win the Qatar 2022 title. And even in the early exchanges, the magnitude of the moment was evident, as the two teams tested each other out. The first real chance of the game came just after the 10-minute mark, when Giroud directed a cross straight into the grateful arms of Jordan Pickford in England\u2019s goal.  The breakthrough for the French wasn\u2019t without controversy.  England winger Bukayo Saka was left on the floor after a tackle from France defender Dayot Upamecano, although Brazilian referee Wilton Sampaio turned away English protests claiming a foul.  And, after a swift counterattack involving Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, England was punished as a bullet of a strike from Tchouam\u00e9ni \u2013 his first World Cup goal \u2013 from outside the box nestled in the bottom corner to give France the lead.  Minutes later, England players were once again pleading with Sampaio for a decision in their favor after Upamecano and Kane tangled legs on the edge of the French penalty box. After a brief deliberation with the video assistant referee (VAR), those pleas were dismissed and the game continued.  Chances were few and far between in the remainder of the first half, with Kane coming closest, his close-range shot saved by his Tottenham Hotspur teammate Hugo Lloris in the France goal.  Immediately after the second half, England came out firing, with Jude Bellingham\u2019s powerful effort from the edge of the box tipped over by Lloris.  The pressure eventually told as Saka was fouled by Tchouam\u00e9ni and the referee pointed to the penalty spot, giving England the perfect opportunity to draw level.  Kane emphatically took advantage, powering the ball into the corner of the France goal, in doing so becoming England\u2019s joint top scorer alongside former Manchester United forward Rooney.  Almost immediately from the restart, France almost reclaimed the lead, but Adrien Rabiot\u2019s first-time effort from the edge of the box was palmed away by Pickford.  England looked the most likely to score, with a header from Harry Maguire glancing off the post as Gareth Southgate\u2019s side turned up the pressure.  Against the run of play, France retook the lead through its all-time top scorer, Giroud heading home his fourth goal of the tournament to give France the lead again with just over 10 minutes remaining.  England had a golden chance to draw level for a second time after Theo Hern\u00e1ndez was adjudged to have fouled Mason Mount, Sampaio awarding a second penalty after reviewing the incident with the help of VAR.  This time, however, Kane blazed his effort over the bar.  Despite consistent pressure, England was unable to find a late equalizer, with Marcus Rashford\u2019s freekick in the game\u2019s final moments landing on the roof of the net.  And, as the referee\u2019s final whistle went, the French players gathered in a celebratory huddle as Kane sank to his haunches in desperation.  England manager Gareth Southgate said his team\u2019s performance \u201cdeserved better\u201d but \u201cin the end goals are decisive.\u201d \u201cI said to the players I didn\u2019t think they could given any more,\u201d Southgate told ITV. \u201cFine margins have decided the game, the way we\u2019ve progressed this tournament has been excellent.  \u201cFrance know they\u2019ve been in a hell of a game. We win together and lose together. We\u2019ve let a couple of goals in and missed a couple of chances. We wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t for the goals (Kane) has scored for us.\u201d Asked after the final whistle if the defeat felt like England had a missed an opportunity to progress at Qatar 2022, England midfielder Jordan Henderson told ITV: \u201cProbably yeah, because we felt really good, performances were really good. \u201cThe focus and the hunger was good every single day, but unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t our night. You gotta give credit to France, they\u2019re a good team, but I still felt it was there for us to win tonight.\u201d Henderson added: \u201cStraight after the game, it\u2019s difficult to find the right words. I thought we gave everything in the game.  \u201cYou know, disappointed to go one \u2013 nil down, but I thought the character and the mentality to keep going in the second half and find the equalizer \u2026 We gave everything and unfortunately it wasn\u2019t our night.\u201d"},

They also explain some of the thinking behind what Kitch was trying to capture about each player with his illustrations. \u201cThese images capture the human truths about each player \u2013 the character, idiosyncrasies, and backstory,\u201d said Bennett. David Beckham, England \u2014 World Cup (1998, 2002 and 2006)  Nate: The uncontainable aura of a man who transcended the sport and captured the world\u2019s eyes. Roger: A work of art about a man who was more objet d\u2019art than footballer. Eusebio, Portugal \u2014 (World Cup 1966)  Nate: Rising high by the crowd that carries him; adored by Benfica, adored by Portugal, adored by the whole world. Roger: Football greatness can make memories of a player you never saw actually play feel immortal. Eusebio is one such player for me. And this image captures that sense of eternal triumph. Garrincha, Brazil \u2014 (World Cup 1958, 1962 and 1966) Nate: I wanted to get this sense of community, a community he was still part of; the shirt stripes extend to those he walked amongst. Roger: A footballer who was known as \u201cAlegria do Povo\u201d (\u201cThe People\u2019s Joy\u201d). These are his people. This is their joy.  Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 , Sweden (World Cup, 2002 and 2006)  Nate: An ever present mythos \u2026 seemingly reversing time whilst being a journeyman through it. The bicycle kick against England echoes this perfectly \u2026 turning back the years \u2026 the dots representing the many teams he has lent his mighty powers to. Roger: A man who is a superhero in his own imagination perfectly presented \u2013 you don\u2019t need to know where the ball is. It is in the net.  Roy Keane, Republic of Ireland \u2014 (World Cup 2002)  Nate: A player who could boil over in a seemingly uncontrolled rage but undoubtedly kept to being a leader. This is what I wanted to capture here; the manic fury of  one of English football\u2019s most imposing figures. Roger: Roy Keane as a firestarter you should never look in the eye unless you want to burn your retina out with the heat of a thousand suns. Gerd M\u00fcller, Germany \u2014 (World Cup, 1970 and 1974)  Nate: A player responding to the moment of the game and an illustrator responding to the moment of the art. Rog\u2019s words, M\u00fcller\u2019s image. Roger: Gerd was a goal machine. He finished with his shin, his crotch, every part of his body. What mattered is that the ball crossed the line. This is pure M\u00fcller. Often ungainly. Always lethal. Lionel Messi, Argentina \u2014 (World Cup, 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018)  Nate: Ladies and gentlemen \u2026 It\u2019s Lionel Messi. Roger: No face needed. A demigod who plays football, and everything else is just shadows. Pele, Brazil \u2014 (World Cup, 1958, 1962, 1966 and 1970)  Nate: The world of football looks at Pele so I wanted to show the Brazil great looking back; with ease and effortlessness. Roger: Less a human being. More the world\u2019s first global billboard. My favorite image in the book. Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, Hungary \u2014 (World Cup, 1954)  Nate: The English said when they first faced Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s and his Hungary side it was like playing men from outer space. Something otherworldly they couldn\u2019t put their finger on \u2026 I wanted this to have a similar resonance.Roger: The mightiest of Magyars \u2026 A goalscorer so prolific they named the goal of year award after him.  Socrates, Brazil \u2014 (World Cup, 1982 and 1986)  Nate: Philosopher by name \u2026 glory that belongs in the Colosseum.  Roger: The coolest footballer ever. Captured to his core. He believed footballing beauty mattered more than results, and that revolutionary politics were perhaps most important of all. Marco van Basten, Holland \u2014 (World Cup, 1990)  Nate: Total. Football. Roger: Brilliant Orange."},

Whether it be draft position or playoff seedings, each game means something to each team as Week 14 of the NFL season kicks off in earnest on Sunday.  After the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 dramatic victory over the Las Vegas Raiders on Thursday \u2013 led by new quarterback Baker Mayfield just two days after signing \u2013 there are a host of huge matches for fans to keep their eyes on.  Jets (7-5) at Bills (9-3) It\u2019s been years since these two were competing atop the AFC East \u2013 such has been the New England Patriots\u2019 recent domination \u2013 but the New York Jets travel to face the Buffalo Bills with both teams holding postseason aspirations.  The teams faced off just five weeks ago in New Jersey, with the Jets stunning the high-flying Bills as the defense tormented Buffalo\u2019s star quarterback Josh Allen.   Allen also suffered an ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) to his right arm \u2013 his throwing arm \u2013 and hasn\u2019t looked quite as explosive since.  Although he\u2019s not playing at the MVP level he was before, the duality to Allen\u2019s game \u2013 notably his athleticism \u2013 have helped defensively, with the team on a three-game winning run.  The Bills are dealing with injuries elsewhere \u2013 Von Miller has been ruled out for the remainder of the season and linebacker Matt Milano is questionable for Sunday\u2019s game \u2013 but the team still has Super Bowl or bust aspirations.  Meanwhile the Jets have revived their season under new quarterback Mike White after replacing Zach Wilson.  Between a dominant defense and an offense loaded with playmakers, the Jets have proven a threat for all opponents. And, as a result, the Jets\u2019 season has metamorphosed from shoots of optimism to playoff hopes.  The AFC East clash, with the Miami Dolphins also having an excellent season, could have big implications as to who advances to the playoffs come January. Buccaneers (6-6) at the 49ers (8-4) This is a battle of the 45-year-old NFL great vs. the 22-year-old we never thought we\u2019d see.  Sunday will see Tom Brady face off against seventh-round rookie Brock Purdy as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers travel west to face the San Francisco 49ers.  Selected with the last pick of this year\u2019s draft, Purdy earned himself the nickname \u201cMr. Irrelevant,\u201d but was thrust into the fray last week against the Dolphins after starting quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo broke his foot.  Despite playing his first meaningful action and with his team\u2019s season possibly on the line, Purdy never looked fazed, leading the 49ers to an important victory.   And this week, before facing off against seven-time Super Bowl champion Brady, San Francisco offensive tackle Trent Williams praised Purdy\u2019s composure in the face of pressure.  \u201cYou would think he\u2019s been in the league 15 years,\u201d Williams said, per NFL. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking, he\u2019ll say: \u2018Shut you\u2019re a*s up.\u2019  \u201cHe ain\u2019t no timid rookie feeling his way around. He will get on you\u2019re a*s. You would think he\u2019s like Peyton Manning or something. Wide receivers not running, you\u2019ll hear him cussing a wide receiver out.\u201d Now Purdy will face Brady, who last time out led the Bucs to a final-drive victory over their division rivals, the New Orleans Saints.  Brady helped Tampa Bay to a 13-point comeback victory, completing a pass to Rachaad White to seal a win which brought the team\u2019s record to level.  Despite having an average season so far by his high standards, Brady and the Bucs sit atop the NFC South division as it aims to make the postseason.  The clash in Santa Clara could come down to how much San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan trusts Purdy and how the injury-riddled 49ers deal with so many players missing.    Vikings (10-2) at Lions (5-7) You might not expect a game between a 10-2 team and a 5-7 team to be of significant note, but this week\u2019s clash between the Minnesota Vikings and the Detroit Lions is a humdinger.  The Lions, who had a terrible start to the season, have won four of their last five games and are getting key players returning to fitness at just the right time.  Meanwhile, the Vikings have had an excellent season under first year coach Kevin O\u2019Connell, primarily down to their 9-0 record in one-score games.  And while you might think a soaring Vikings team would dispatch a scrappy Lions team, with Amon-Ra St. Brown and D\u2019Andre Swift back and firing for Detroit, it looks to be a tough encounter.  For Detroit, with time running out on the season, they need to effectively win the remaining games of their season to hold any hopes of advancing to playoff football, and a division victory over the Vikings will go a long way in achieving their goals.  How to watch Here\u2019s how to catch these teams and others across the league in action, from wherever you are.

But they fear a harsh new anti-gay law passed by Russian lawmakers will leave them little choice.", "date": "2022-12-11", "author": "Anna Chernova,Sana Noor Haq", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 to connect with a trained counselor or visit the NSPL site. Young mothers Yana and Yaroslava don\u2019t want to leave Russia with their 6-year-old son. But they fear a harsh new anti-gay law passed by Russian lawmakers will leave them little choice.  \u201cWe are citizens, same as everyone else. We pay taxes, support charities. But the government is doing everything to force us to leave the country. Honestly, it is scary to stay,\u201d Yaroslava told CNN.   Russia\u2019s upper house of parliament gave its final approval in late November to a new legislative package that toughens an existing law on so-called \u201cLGBTQ propaganda,\u201d and it was signed into law Monday by President Vladimir Putin. The added restrictions on \u201cpropaganda\u201d seen as promoting \u201cnon-traditional sexual relations and/or preferences\u201d carry heavy penalties \u2013 a move activists say will put LGBTQ communities under heightened scrutiny and surveillance. As the Kremlin prepared to finalize the expansion of the 2013 discriminatory anti-gay law, members of the LGBTQ community in Russia told CNN they feared the uncertain future ahead.  \u201cWe are the most vulnerable category within LGBT. We have a child, and they (Russian authorities) can put pressure on us,\u201d Yaroslava said. Yana and Yaroslava, both self-employed marketing workers, are raising their child in Russia\u2019s second-largest city of St. Petersburg. Both lesbians, they have asked not to disclose their last names for security reasons.  \u201cOur mere existence is illegal for our state and even for our child,\u201d Yaroslava said.   \u201cAccording to the law, we are people of non-traditional sexual orientation and children should not see us or that we exist at all. Our son sees us. By that logic, our very existence is \u2018propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations\u2019 within our family. That means we are illegal.\u201d  The pair say they have created a bubble of protection around their family in order to avoid scrutiny from authorities. The measures include using private accounts on social media, having access to a network of trusted people, sending their son to a private kindergarten where the fact a kid has two moms is less likely to spark a homophobic reaction, and using a private hospital where they run less risk of a doctor calling child protection authorities to make inquiries about their family set-up, they said.   But, the couple say they are reluctant to leave because of a lack of financial resources and available relocation programs in LGBTQ-friendly countries, even though they are fearful about living under the toughened legislation.  \u2018We expect a new wave of hatred\u2019  The new legislative package ratchets up the country\u2019s existing ban on spreading so-called \u201cpropaganda of non-traditional sexual relations\u201d among minors, making it illegal to share any information across all media and all ages.   Some have taken to self-censorship in anticipation of the law\u2019s passage.  Moscow-based publisher Eksmo took preemptive measures by censoring some fragments of the book \u201cShattered,\u201d which contains descriptions of sexual scenes between two men, even before the law was finalized. The publisher explained it had hidden 3% of the text \u2013 covering it in black ink \u2013 \u201cin order not to hide the fact of censorship,\u201d the publisher said in a press release. \u201cI\u2019m glad that the publisher decided not to cut out the text, but rather to paint it over in black. Where there were feelings, the characters\u2019 attraction, where there was their experience of getting to know their own sexuality, there will now be empty black lines,\u201d said the author, Max Falk, according to the press release. The story, published in October, is about the \u201clove and friendship of two young men\u201d from different social circles in Russia.  Recent novels centered on LGBTQ characters have attracted swathes of readers, causing a stir among Russian lawmakers.   The 2021 bestseller \u201cSummer in a Pioneer Tie,\u201d which explores the budding romance between two men who met in a summer camp in Soviet Kharkiv in the 1980s, sold a record 200,000 hard copies and 32,000 online copies. Lawmakers and public figures responded by lashing out with criticism and calling for beefed-up anti-LGBTQ legislation.  \u201cAs an author of books that raise [the LGBTQ] topic, of course, I am very concerned about this,\u201d gay writer Ksenia told CNN. She asked not to give her last name for fear of repercussions.  On the day the bill passed through the lower house of Parliament, Ksenia discovered both her books containing LGBTQ references had disappeared from Labirint, an online bookstore. The store confirmed in a press release they had \u201ctemporarily suspended\u201d selling some books to \u201canalyze their content for the presence of prohibited information in them.\u201d  \u201cSelf-censorship is a big thing,\u201d Ksenia told CNN, pointing out that the law had not even come into effect at the time of speaking.  \u201cI don\u2019t know how this law will affect the distribution of this content, but I assume that somehow people will find it,\u201d Ksenia added.  She is hopeful that the new package will not stop books about LGBTQ characters from being published and read.  As human rights activists anticipate censorship in the form of blocked websites, banned books and regular fines, LBGTQ bloggers and content creators are making their social media channels private and deleting posts, according to the Sphere Foundation, an organization that defends the rights of LGBTQ people in Russia and has launched a petition against the new bill.  \u201cWe expect a new wave of hatred,\u201d Alexander Belik, head of the Sphere Foundation\u2019s advocacy program, told CNN. \u201cThis law enhances public rhetoric of hate.\u201d  Since the debate on the restrictions began, LGBTQ people have become increasingly worried for their safety, according to Belik.  \u201cThe community is in an alarmed state,\u201d Belik said of the new law, suggesting that it will induce self-censorship among LGBTQ advocacy groups who fear a potential Kremlin crackdown.  \u201cWe urge the LGBTQ community not to succumb to panic and continue living their lives,\u201d Belik said.   He said the organization would continue fighting for the abolition of the law and support those who may be persecuted under it. Russian politicians condemn \u2018foreign values\u2019  The Kremlin has consistently described LGBTQ communities in Russia as existing in opposition with \u201ctraditional values,\u201d a line of rhetoric that activists say directly harms LGBTQ people across the country.  Since the first law on \u201cgay propaganda\u201d passed in 2013, Russia has seen repeated crackdowns on the gay community, most notably in 2017 and again in 2019 in the southern region of Chechnya, where activists reported dozens of men and women were detained and some tortured and killed for their sexual orientation, and no proper investigation followed. Putin framed what he described as the Western renunciation of \u201ctraditional values\u201d as a \u201cchallenge\u201d to Russian society in a speech in September announcing the annexation of four Ukrainian regions, in violation of international law. At the time, he was facing unusual criticism even from Kremlin loyalists over Moscow\u2019s huge losses on the battlefield in Ukraine, and low morale at home.   \u201cDo we want our schools to impose on our children, from their earliest days in school, perversions that lead to degradation and extinction? Do we want to drum into their heads the ideas that certain other genders exist along with women and men and to offer them gender reassignment surgery? Is that what we want for our country and our children?\u201d Putin said inside the Kremlin\u2019s Georgievsky Hall.  \u201cThis is all unacceptable to us. We have a different future of our own,\u201d Putin continued.  The new package bans all materials that the authorities consider to be LBGTQ \u201cpropaganda,\u201d making such material illegal among Russians of all ages, constituting an offense liable to a fine of up to $6,400 for individuals and up to roughly $80,000 for legal entities. Foreigners could receive up to 15 days in jail or deportation for breaking the law. The main difference between the original iteration of the law and the expanded version is that now, the prohibition of so-called same-sex \u201cpropaganda\u201d will apply across all ages and across all media. The chairman of Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, dubbed the new legislation an \u201cAnswer to Blinken Law,\u201d referring to a tweet in which US Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned the proposed expansion of the ban.  \u201cIt is the best answer to the Secretary of State Mr. Blinken. Stop imposing on us foreign values. You destroyed your values \u2013 we\u2019ll see how it all ends, but it will definitely be sad,\u201d Volodin said to the State Duma \u2013 Russia\u2019s lower house \u2013 after it voted unanimously to pass the amendments in the final reading.  Putin\u2019s enforcement of anti-LGBTQ laws is part of a wider trend of repressive policies as the Kremlin situates itself in opposition to so-called Western values, according to Dan Healey, a professor of modern Russian history at the University of Oxford.  \u201cThose are being knit into a wider social and cultural and defense policy, you know, around so-called traditional values. And it\u2019s just reducing the space within which a non-heterosexual existence can comfortably take place in Russia,\u201d Healey told CNN.  \u201cThe consequences for LGBTQ people in Russia are wide ranging and really, really repressive. They become a kind of underground people who are unable to become visible in public space.\u201d Transgender rights under threat  Russian activists claim the authorities\u2019 renewed targeting of LGBTQ communities in Russia is linked to Moscow\u2019s faltering war in Ukraine.  They suggest the purpose of the new legislative package is to distract the nation from the domestic backlash against Putin\u2019s partial mobilization, announced in September, and the war of attrition that has exhausted the nation\u2019s military resources.   \u201cAmong other things, it is also diverting attention from what is happening in the country. As soon as it gets a little worse, we have an enemy to point at: it\u2019s because of them that it\u2019s so rough,\u201d said Anton Macintosh of Russia\u2019s first transgender support group, T-Action. The organization was labeled a \u201cforeign agent\u201d \u2013 a status close to \u201ctraitor\u201d that obstructs operating in Russia  \u2013 the day after Russia\u2019s parliament passed the third and final reading of the law.   Macintosh said his organization had been contacted by increasing numbers of people worried that they would not be able to receive proper medical support in their gender transition processes. The process is currently legal if a person passes an extensive review to obtain a psychiatrist\u2019s note, Macintosh said, but it remains unclear how the new legislative package will be implemented.  \u201cUnlike a cisgender person, when visiting a doctor or being admitted to the hospital, a transgender person doesn\u2019t have the option to hide their status,\u201d Macintosh said, referencing the physical changes resulting from hormone therapy. \u201cWill there be proper healthcare available for transgender people?\u201d  The less access to support groups a transgender person has, the more terrified and hopeless they are likely to feel, Macintosh explained. Stigmatizing their status causes even more emotional strain, he said.   \u201cWe receive a lot of suicidal letters. We do surveys every three months asking about emotional well-being. A lot of people have been sharing hard feelings about how they don\u2019t know how they are going to live,\u201d Macintosh said.  \u201cThis is not only an anti-gay law, this is also explicitly an anti-trans law,\u201d said Vanya Solovey, an advocacy and program officer for Eastern Europe and Central Asia at the trans rights group Transgender Europe, referencing the part of the package that forbids the promotion of information that could cause people to want to change their gender assigned at birth.  \u201cIt explicitly targets raising awareness about gender transition. And this is, of course, very concerning,\u201d he added.  \u201cWhen someone (Putin) at this high level of authority spreads these misconceptions, again this increases the stigma that trans people have to face.\u201d \u2018Another brick in building an autocracy\u2019  When the bill passed its first reading in the State Duma in October, Russia\u2019s first transgender politician, Yulia Alyoshina, made the decision to step down from her role as a regional head of the Civic Initiative party, and end her political career. \u201cI have never been involved in such propaganda, but I have no idea how to continue to conduct public political activity as an open transgender woman,\u201d she said in a Telegram post.  Alyoshina said she had been discriminated against as a transgender politician on numerous occasions since she got her new passport in 2020, but says this law will complicate further the already difficult life of all LGBTQ people in Russia.  \u201cThe law is discriminatory,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAny kind of information can fall under the term \u2018propaganda.\u2019 As it is not clearly spelled out, this will be left to the discretion of the courts.\u201d  \u201cThe text of the law rejects the social equivalence of \u2018traditional\u2019 and \u2018non-traditional\u2019 preferences,\u201d she added. \u201cThis means that LGBT people in Russia are recognized by the authorities at the legislative level as socially unequal. In other words, second-rate people.\u201d  Alyoshina said the new package is characteristic of an authoritarian government\u2019s policy towards society.  \u201cThe sexual life of citizens is a part of human freedom that an authoritarian regime cannot tolerate,\u201d she said. \u201cThe adoption of the law is just another brick in building an autocracy in Russia.\u201d CNN\u2019s Frederik Pleitgen and Claudia Otto contributed to this report."},

The individual was slightly injured and is being treated at hospital, while police are investigating, Spain\u2019s foreign ministry said.  Kyiv\u2019s ambassador to Spain, Serhil Pohoreltsev, was the intended recipient of the envelope, it added. A separate letter bomb, which was deactivated at a weapons manufacturer in northern Spain late Wednesday, had the same return address as the one that exploded in Ukraine\u2019s embassy in Madrid, a senior Spanish official told Spanish radio station SER.  \u201cThe return address on the envelope is an email that is the same\u201d on both envelopes, Rosa Serrano, the top Spanish government official in the Aragon region where the second bomb arrived, told SER. The explosive sent to the weapons maker in the city of Zaragoza, in Aragon, \u201capparently came from Ukraine,\u201d Serrano said, adding that authorities suspect the one at the embassy may have come from Ukraine, too. An executive at the arms manufacturer was apparently aware about the Madrid explosion, so when an envelope arrived soon after, that no one seemed to recognize, the company called the police, Serrano said. The bomb squad arrived, a security perimeter was established and police determined there were explosives inside the envelope, designed to explode upon opening. It was deactivated, Serrano said.  Serrano didn\u2019t identify the firm, but Spanish media reported its name and said it manufactures rocket launchers that Spain has sent to Ukraine to fight against Russia\u2019s invasion of that country. CNN could not immediately confirm that detail. \u201cI know the firm has been an arms manufacturer a long time, with state-of-the-art facilities,\u201d Serrano said in the radio interview. CNN has reached out to Spanish police for comment. \u2018They will not succeed\u2019  Ukraine has ramped up security at all of its embassies in response. Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson for Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, said the life of the injured employee \u201cis not at risk,\u201d and descsribed the staffer\u2019s position as \u201ccommandant.\u201d  Police say it is too early to know whether the explosion took place when the embassy worker tried to open an envelope, or simply move it. Nikolenko said no one else had been injured, and that Kuleba \u201chas issued an urgent instruction to step up security at all Ukrainian embassies abroad\u201d following the incident. \u201cWhoever is behind this explosion they will not succeed in intimidating Ukrainian diplomats or stopping their daily work to strengthen Ukraine and to counter Russian aggression,\u201d Nikolenko quoted Kuleba as saying. Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Jose Manuel Albares spoke to Ambassador Pohoreltsev after the incident, Madrid said. The person injured was a Ukrainian worker, according to the statement. Spain, a NATO country, has sent military equipment to Ukraine to help its armed forces fight Russia\u2019s invasion. The Ukrainian embassy is located in the Hortaleza district in northeastern Madrid."},

Its shock defeat to Japan on the opening day put the Germans in a difficult position, but it rallied in its second game against Spain to earn a hard-fought draw.  It means the 2014 world champion, which sits bottom of the group on one point, now needs to beat Costa Rica on Thursday and hope Spain beats Japan in order to progress into the knockout stages of the competition.  A draw in the group\u2019s other game could be enough for Germany but its fate would then depend on goal difference.  Speaking after the vital draw against Spain, Germany manager Hansi Flick said he hoped his team would gather some confidence for the crunch match at the Al Bayt Stadium after a more positive performance against Spain.  \u201cMaybe it is the spark we need,\u201d Flick said. \u201cThe team fought hard and I am very satisfied with their mentality. These are the things we want and we know that we did take the first step. \u201cWe want to have the conditions against Costa Rica to reach the knockout phase.\u201d    Group leader Spain, meanwhile, needs just a point against Japan to ensure progression into the round of 16 \u2013 it can even afford to lose the match depending on what happens in Germany\u2019s game with Costa Rica.  Spain coach Luis Enrique is determined for his side to enjoy their experience in Qatar and has defended his streaming sessions online in which he talks to fans.  \u201cThe only goal I set for my players \u2026 before this training camp 16 days ago, I told them we need to have fun, fun,\u201d he told reporters.  \u201cWe need to enjoy this because you have to have joy in your job.\u201d It\u2019s a philosophy that seems to be working; with Spain\u2019s young side producing impressive displays on the world stage.  For Japan, which stunned Germany in its first game, it now needs to produce another surprise by beating Spain after losing to Costa Rica in its last match.  \u201cTomorrow is going to be a high-pressure game for all players but we must believe in ourselves,\u201d Japan manager Hajime Moriyasu told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cThey must believe in themselves, they must. They must believe in their team mates in order to fight against our opponent. Hopefully, they will be at their best and the result will follow.\u201d Morocco bid to upset Belgium and Croatia Meanwhile, for three teams in Group F, it\u2019s all to play for on Thursday.  Belgium, Croatia and Morocco can all still qualify for the knockout rounds in what promises to be a fascinating round of matches.  Belgium and Croatia will play each other, while Morocco faces Canada \u2013 which is already out of the tournament.  Many Moroccans will still be recovering from an emotional victor against Belgium on Sunday, in what was the country\u2019s first World Cup win since 1998 \u2013 and its third ever. \u201cIf we get through to the knockout stage, I think we will be very dangerous going forward,\u201d Moroccan manager Walid Regragui told reporters earlier this week.    Anything other than a place in the round of 16 will be a major disappointment for both Belgium and Croatia.  The latter was the defeated finalist in 2018 and needs just a draw against Belgium to ensure progression through the group. But coach Zlatko Dalic says he refuses to entertain playing for anything but a win.  \u201cWe must not accept the option of having only one point to end the match with Belgium,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThere are no easy games. Belgium need a win but we will also aim for a win.\u201d Belgium, meanwhile, has struggled to find its feet in the tournament so far.  It was largely outplayed despite beating Canada its opening game and suffered a confidence-knocking defeat to Morocco the last time out.  However, coach Roberto Martinez says his team will be ready for the showdown and hopes his star players, such as Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, can turn its fortunes around.  \u201cWe have to stay together now and become stronger.

The law proposes to ban all Russians from promoting or \u201cpraising\u201d homosexual relationships or publicly suggesting that they are \u201cnormal.\u201d It also prohibits \u201cpropaganda\u201d of pedophilia and gender reassignment in advertising, books, films.

The bill says that materials published online that include information about pedophilia, sex changes or so-called LGBT propaganda will be included in the list of websites that will be monitored or blocked by Russia\u2019s Internet watchdog Roskomnadzor.

There is no indication that Messi kicked the shirt intentionally. \u201cHe better pray to God that I don\u2019t find him!!\u201d \u00c1lvarez added in another tweet, with a series of angry emojis. \u201cJust like I respect Argentina, he has to respect Mexico! I\u2019m not talking about the country as a whole, just about the bulls**t that Messi pulled.\u201d  \u00c1lvarez, who is widely considered one of the best pound-for-pound boxers ever after winning world championships in four weight classes, added in one reply to a journalist: \u201cIt\u2019s one thing them being better than us (in football), it\u2019s another thing to have respect.\u201d CNN had asked Alvarez\u2019s representatives for further comment but did not receive an immediate response. The Argentinean Football Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a comment to CNN, Marcelo M\u00e9ndez, Messi\u2019s representative, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a kick to the jersey or anything like that as everyone can see on the footage.  \u201cI believe there\u2019s literally no one who can even question once Leo\u2019s fair play through his career. He\u2019s one of the most honest footballers ever, never cheats, always respects rivals \u2026 I reckon this debate doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Messi\u2019s former Argentina teammate Sergio Ag\u00fcero responded to \u00c1lvarez initial message on Twitter, saying: \u201cMr. Canelo, don\u2019t look for excuses or problems, surely you don\u2019t know about football and what happens in a changing room.  \u201cThe shirts are always on the floor after games have finished due to sweat and then if you look properly, he makes the movement to remove his boot and accidentally hits it.\u201d Mexico captain Andr\u00e9s Guardado also came to Messi\u2019s defense, saying that \u201cunfortunately, perhaps Canelo does not understand what is experienced in a locker room.\u201d \u201cThat is why I can understand the reaction of being offended by seeing the Mexico shirt on the ground and everything that has gone viral,\u201d Guardado told Argentina\u2019s TyC Sports. \u201cBut to me, it seems silly that this is being talked about because it doesn\u2019t matter much.  \u201cFor me, I repeat, Leo has had made many gestures not only with me, with many colleagues who know what he is like and beyond what has been said, it is purely to generate controversy or sell things.\u201d \u201cEvery time I have had the opportunity to ask Messi for something, a change of shirt or a photo with my son, he has always done it.\u201d Argentina would go on to qualify top of its group after a 2-0 win over Poland \u2013 despite Messi missing a penalty in the match \u2013 while Mexico agonizingly failed to qualify for the knockout stage despite beating Saudi Arabia 2-1."},

But St\u00e9phanie Frappart\u2019s traditional anonymity has been broken for a different reason \u2013 she will make history on Thursday as the first woman to referee a men\u2019s World Cup match. Alongside assistants Neuza Back from Brazil and Karen Diaz from Mexico, the Frenchwoman will form part of an all-female refereeing trio officiating Costa Rica vs. Germany in their Group E match. Six female match officials have been officiating at this World Cup \u2013 referees Frappart, Rwanda\u2019s Salima Mukansanga and Japan\u2019s Yoshimi Yamashita as well as assistant referees Back, Diaz and Kathryn Nesbitt of the US.  FIFA announced their appointment back in May, when Frappart found out that she was going to the 2022 Qatar World Cup. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise, you cannot believe it and after two or three minutes, you realize that you are going to the World Cup. It\u2019s amazing, not only for me, but also for my family and also for the French referees,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. Throughout her career, Frappart has achieved a seemingly endless series of firsts. In 2019, she became the first female referee to take charge of a Ligue 1 match, in August 2019 the first to take charge of a major men\u2019s European match, and in 2020, the first to officiate a men\u2019s UEFA Champions League match. \u201cI knew that my life changed after 2019 because most people recognized me in the street,\u201d Frappart recalls.  \u201cSo I am like a role model, for women referees but I think it [also] inspired some women in society or in companies to take more and more responsibility.\u201d Already at this World Cup, Frappart has been the fourth official on two occasions \u2013 becoming the first female official at a men\u2019s World Cup match at Mexico vs. Poland. Mukasanga and Yamashita have also been the fourth official at two and four games of this World Cup respectively. But there is an obvious tension between these historic moments for gender equality in football and the place in which they are happening as women\u2019s rights are severely restricted in Qatar. According to Amnesty International, women remain tied to a male guardian in Qatar\u2013 usually their father, brother, grandfather, uncle or husband \u2013 and require their permission for important decisions such as marrying, accessing reproductive healthcare and working in many government jobs. CNN has reached out to the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) for comment but at the time of publication had not received a response. \u201cI was many times in Qatar \u2026 for the preparation of the World Cup, I was always welcomed in a good way. I don\u2019t know how life is there but I didn\u2019t make the decision to go there or to organize the World Cup,\u201d Frappart says.  \u201cSo now, 10 years after, it\u2019s difficult to say something, but I hope that \u2026 this World Cup will improve life for women there.\u201d  \u2018When you\u2019re a woman, you need to prove you have the quality\u2019 At the World Cup, on football\u2019s biggest stage, the pressure of refereeing a game is at its most intense. A referee might make 245 decisions in a single game, Sky Sports estimates, and if just one is wrong, it will be analyzed in microscopic detail.  It could alter the course of a game, or even a team\u2019s World Cup \u2013 denying it a title or ensuring it progresses no further in the tournament.  \u201cWhen you make a mistake, it\u2019s more important than if a player makes a mistake \u2013 there are more consequences for the teams,\u201d Frappart says. \u201cIt\u2019s also easy to say that it\u2019s the fault of the referee and not the fault of our team so when you lose.\u201d As referees work their way up to the highest echelons of the game, this pressure changes. \u201cIt\u2019s more from the media and [about] the money because you know that every decision is important and will make a difference for the team,\u201d Frappart says. \u201cBut when you start in the local clubs, it\u2019s more difficult with the spectators and with the environment.\u201d Inevitably, female referees are heavily scrutinized too as they straddle two traditionally male-dominated fields: football and leadership. \u201cThere were many questions involved if she\u2019s there because she\u2019s a woman, perhaps she will not follow the game and everything,\u201d Frappart recalls when she made her debut in Ligue 1.  \u201cIt\u2019s not only in football, but I think in every job when you\u2019re a woman \u2026 you need to prove that you have the quality and after that they let you continue.\u201d But as Frappart refereed more matches, the stance towards her changed. \u201cNow, it\u2019s not a question of gender. It\u2019s now only a question about steel, [about] competencies. So now it\u2019s ok, after one or two games, they left me alone and without any more media around.\u201d \u2018I worked hard\u2019 When Frappart first began playing football at ten years old in 1993, women\u2019s football barely registered as a significant landmark on the sporting landscape. The inaugural edition of the women\u2019s World Cup had been held just two years previously, with great success in China, but there was neither a women\u2019s Champions League in Europe nor a National Women\u2019s Soccer League (NWSL) in the USA and professional female referees were non-existent. It was only in 2017 when Bibiana Steinhaus took charge of a Bundesliga match that a woman officiated a top-level men\u2019s league match. Frappart\u2019s appointment as a referee at a men\u2019s World Cup is another step forward in a \u201cvery sexist sport,\u201d Costa Rica manager Luis Fernando said, according to Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to reach the point that she has reached, I think it\u2019s good for football and a positive step for football, to show that it\u2019s opening up for everyone,\u201d he added. Similarly, in Rwanda, Mukansanga recalls never seeing a female referee to use as a role model for her own aspirations. \u201cI worked hard and followed the men\u2019s dreams because they were the people surrounding me,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. \u201cThey\u2019re all men. We had one World Cup referee here in Rwanda who went to the World Cup twice so he inspired me a lot and I kept working hard to be like him.\u201d With women refereeing and the matches at the Qatar World Cup broadcast to huge audiences worldwide, Frappart hopes that it will encourage more women to pick up a whistle. Already this change is beginning to take place \u2013 in the UK alone, there was a 72% increase in qualified women referees between 2016 and 2020, according to the FA.  \u201cSo if you have more referees on the TV perhaps it might make it easier for women to say, okay, this is possible. Because if you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible for us, you cannot say: \u2018Okay, I want to be a referee.\u2019\u201d CNN\u2019s Alasdair Howorth contributed reporting."},

The guest, Ngozi Fulani, is the CEO of Sistah Space, an organization that provides specialist services to women of African and Caribbean heritage affected by abuse.  Fulani was attending a royal function on domestic abuse organized by the Queen Consort on Tuesday evening when she said a member of staff began a line of questioning that the palace called \u201cunacceptable and deeply regrettable.\u201d Fulani said that the person persistently asked about her heritage and would not accept that she was a British national. Sistah Space shared a rough transcript of the conversation on Twitter on Wednesday. Fulani said that, after identifying herself as British-born, the person asked her \u201cwhere do you really come from;\u201d \u201cwhere do your people come from;\u201d and \u201cwhen did you first come here?\u201d  When Fulani answered she was from the London neighborhood of Hackney, the household member insisted: \u201cNo, what part of Africa are YOU from?\u201d as quoted on the Sistah Space twitter account. Buckingham Palace, which has not named the household member involved in the incident, said earlier today that the individual concerned had apologized and \u201cstepped aside from her honorary role with immediate effect.\u201d  Sistah Space said that it \u201cserves no purpose to name & shame\u201d the person in question on its Twitter account on Wednesday, adding \u201cit is the system that needs to be revised.\u201d  \u201cYes the person was offensive, but it serves no purpose to name & shame her, it would make us just as bad. We prefer that this be handled kindly,\u201d Sistah Space said. British media have identified the Buckingham Palace official as Lady Susan Hussey, who served as the late Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s lady in waiting for more than 60 years and is a godmother to the Prince of Wales. CNN has reached out to Ngozi Fulani and Buckingham Palace for further comment from the household member in question.  A Buckingham Palace spokesperson acknowledged the incident and said the palace was taking the situation \u201cextremely seriously.\u201d \u201cUnacceptable and deeply regrettable comments have been made. We have reached out to Ngozi Fulani on this matter, and are inviting her to discuss all elements of her experience in person if she wishes,\u201d the spokesperson said.  \u201cIn the meantime, the individual concerned would like to express her profound apologies for the hurt caused and has stepped aside from her honorary role with immediate effect.\u201d News of the encounter came to light as the Prince and Princess of Wales traveled to the US ahead of the second iteration of the Earthshot Prize Awards later this week. A spokesman for William said: \u201cRacism has no place in our society, these comments were unacceptable. It\u2019s right that the individual concerned has stepped down.\u201d The incident is likely to revive concerns that the palace is elitist and out of touch when it comes to issues of race and identity. The palace has, in recent years, faced allegations of racist behavior, including in its hiring practices decades ago and the treatment of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. A former counterterrorism police chief said Tuesday that Meghan and Harry had faced \u201cdisgusting and very real\u201d threats from right-wing extremists.  Meghan claimed in an interview with Oprah Winfrey last year that an unnamed member of the family made remarks about the skin color of their unborn baby while she was pregnant with Archie. Prince William later said the royal family was \u201cvery much not a racist family.\u201d Sign up for CNN\u2019s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what\u2019s happening behind palace walls."},

Alexis Mac Allister\u2019s scuffed effort 60 seconds into the second half broke the deadlock before Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez\u2019s brilliant curled shot sealed the three points as Argentina advanced as Group C winners.  The opener came after Messi, Argentina\u2019s all-time top goalscorer, had his penalty saved by Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny.  \u00c1lvarez\u2019s sublime finish midway through the second half capped off a nail-biting evening for Argentina, who will now face Australia. Poland advanced to the knockout stages by the skin of its teeth, qualifying on goal difference.  The other Group C game was a thrilling affair, Mexico beating Saudi Arabia 2-1, but the win wasn\u2019t enough for El Tri and Poland will now play France in a last-16 match on Sunday.  An enthralling evening Not for the first time in his career, all the pressure laid firmly at Messi\u2019s door, the 35-year-old endlessly striving to emerge from the long shadow which Diego Maradona has cast over the Argentina national side.  Playing in his 999th professional match, Messi looked up for the challenge, troubling Poland from the opening minute.  While the Polish attack offered very little throughout the game, Argentina cranked up the pressure \u2013 and both Messi and left-back Marcos Acu\u00f1a coming close.  Argentina was offered a great chance to break the deadlock when the video assistant referee adjudged that Messi had been fouled by Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny when he was hit in the face by the Polish goalkeeper\u2019s flailing hand.  However, Messi\u2019s penalty was brilliantly saved by Szcz\u0119sny\u2019s who somehow beat the ball away one-handed.  It was the crowning moment of a busy first half for Szcz\u0119sny, who finished the opening 45 minutes with nine saves to his name as Argentina piled on the pressure.  The penalty save was Szcz\u0119sny\u2019s second of the tournament already and he became only the second goalkeeper since 1966 to save a penalty at the World Cup having conceding it himself, after Joel Bats for France against Brazil in 1986, according to Opta Stats.  It took just under 60 seconds for Argentina to break the deadlock after the break.  A cut back cross from right back Nahuel Molina fell to the feet of Mac Allister whose scuffed effort just managed to sneak past Szcz\u0119sny and send Stadium 974 into delirium.  It was Mac Allister\u2019s first international goal, and continues his excellent year \u2013  he came to this World Cup as the top scorer for his Premier League club, Brighton and Hove Albion, this season.  That goal seemed to relax the Argentina players and fans inside the ground. Messi, \u00c1lvarez and \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda began to turn on the flair, toying with the Poland defense.  Midway through the second half, \u00c1lvarez showed why he\u2019d been brought in for this game \u2013 he\u2019d started the first two group games on the bench \u2013 curling home to get his first World Cup goal.  With Poland opening up at it attempted to claw itself back in the game, more spaces opened up for Argentina, with Messi, \u00c1lvarez and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez all going close. Group C\u2019s conclusion must have been an agonizing watch for Poland\u2019s fans. For a brief period of time during the match, Poland and Mexico were tied on goal difference. That meant Poland was slated to advance via its better disciplinary record.  With Poland fans checking their phones furiously to keep tabs on proceedings and with all eyes on whether any Polish players picked up a yellow card, there was one last twist to Wednesday\u2019s proceedings. That was delivered by Salem Al Dawsari\u2019s 95th-minute goal which gave Poland had a superior goal difference, assuring it\u2019s progression to the next stage."},

The sixth and latest bomb was detected Thursday afternoon and sent to the US embassy in Madrid. It was intercepted at around 12.30 p.m. local time at the security post of the embassy, a police source told CNN.  The envelope was detonated in a controlled environment, according to two US officials. No one was injured in the process, the officials said. \u201cWe are grateful to Spanish law enforcement for their assistance with this matter,\u201d Jamie Martin, a spokeswoman for the US Embassy in Madrid, told CNN.  Security was increased at the embassy after suspicious packages were sent to other embassies Wednesday, a US official said. A US State Department spokesperson said it \u201cwill continue to evaluate the security situation and provide updates as appropriate. The US Embassy in Madrid remains open for American Citizen Services. We thank Spanish law enforcement for their assistance.\u201d A previous bomb, sent to an air force base near Madrid, was discovered before dawn Thursday, after one exploded at the Ukrainian embassy in the capital Wednesday and another was deactivated at an arms manufacturer.  A device addressed to Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez arrived in the post at his official Moncloa compound on November 24 and his security detail singled it out as suspicious. After establishing a security perimeter, they conducted a \u201ccontrolled explosion\u201d of the envelope, an interior ministry statement said.   The bomb \u201cwould be similar, for its features and content\u201d to those received on Wednesday at the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid and at the arms manufacturer Instalaza in Zaragoza, and on Thursday at Spain\u2019s Torrejon air force base near Madrid, the statement said.  The most recent letter bomb was intercepted just before dawn Thursday after being sent to the Torrejon air force base.  Spanish defense ministry officials said a suspicious envelope was detected by a scanner at the base. The scan indicated the envelope could have \u201csome type of mechanism\u201d inside, a statement said. Police were called to the base to analyze the envelope, which was addressed to the Satellite Center at the air base.  The Spanish defense ministry also received a letter bomb addressed to Defense Minister Margarita Robles, the Secretary of State for Security Rafael Perez said Thursday.  Perez said the letters were likely sent from Spanish territory, and that in four out of the five cases, protection measures worked successfully to neutralize the bombs.  People should remain \u201ccalm,\u201d the minister said, and there was no reason yet to justify raising a terror threat.  Earlier targets The latest developments followed the discovery of two letter bombs on Wednesday. The first exploded at the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid in the afternoon, injuring an employee, Spanish officials said.  That envelope, addressed to the Ukrainian ambassador to Spain, exploded after being handled by a Ukrainian worker at the embassy, Spain\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement. Later, in the evening, police deactivated a letter bomb at a weapons manufacturer in northern Spain, a senior Spanish official said.  The envelope sent to the arms maker had the same return address as the envelope that exploded at the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid, said the official, Rosa Serrano, in an interview with Spain\u2019s radio station SER late Wednesday.  \u201cThe return address on the envelope is an email that is the same\u201d on both envelopes, said Serrano, who is the top Spanish government official in the Aragon region where the second letter bomb arrived.  The envelope at the weapons maker in the city of Zaragoza, in Aragon, \u201capparently came from Ukraine,\u201d Serrano said, adding that authorities suspect the one at the embassy may have also come from Ukraine.  An executive at the arms manufacturer was apparently aware of the Madrid explosion, so when an envelope arrived soon after that no one seemed to recognize, the company called police, Serrano said.  The bomb squad arrived and police determined there were explosives inside the envelope, designed to explode on opening. It was deactivated, Serrano said.  Serrano didn\u2019t identify the firm, but Spanish media reported its name and said it manufactured rocket launchers that Spain has sent to Ukraine as it battles Russia\u2019s invasion. CNN could not immediately confirm that detail.  \u201cI know the firm has been an arms manufacturer a long time, with state-of-the-art facilities,\u201d Serrano said in the radio interview.  Police notified Spain\u2019s National Court, which investigates terrorism, about each of the letter bombs, the statement said.   The interior ministry has ordered increased security measures at all embassies and consulates in Spain, as well as other sites that require special protection. Security had already been boosted after the start of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.   Al Goodman reported from Madrid and Eve Brennan wrote in London.

Having failed to qualify for the last World Cup, the tournament in Qatar is the first time since 2014 that the USMNT has reached the last 16, which comes courtesy of hard-fought draws against Wales and England before Tuesday\u2019s win against Iran.  The team is now setting its sights on loftier ambitions.  \u201cWe\u2019re not finished yet,\u201d defender Walker Zimmerman told CNN\u2019s This Morning on Wednesday. \u201cI think the narrative continues, we\u2019re still going to try and do that and accomplish our goal of winning the World Cup.  \u201cI think if we\u2019re able to do that, we\u2019re going to inspire a lot of young players, a lot of young Americans to pick up the sport and, hopefully, make them proud.\u201d The USMNT\u2019s best performance at a World Cup in recent memory was reaching the quarterfinals in 2002 before losing to Germany. Gregg Berhalter\u2019s side goes into Saturday\u2019s knockout game against the Netherlands as the underdog, eight places lower than its opponent in FIFA\u2019s world rankings.  But that\u2019s unlikely to shake the team\u2019s confidence. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to get to the next round, but we want to keep going,\u201d Berhalter told This Morning.  \u201cWe had two tournaments that we\u2019re looking at: the group stage tournament and the knockout tournament. And now, we\u2019re here in the knockouts, we just want to keep this thing rolling.\u201d Against Iran, star forward Christian Pulisic scored the only goal of the game before leaving the field with an abdominal injury.  Berhalter said Pulisic will \u201chopefully\u201d be fit to play against the Netherlands and praised the Chelsea player\u2019s talent and work ethic.  Speaking on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America, USMNT captain Tyler Adams said Pulisic had \u201cput it all on the line.\u201d  \u201cHe\u2019s doing alright, he\u2019s in great spirits,\u201d Adams added. \u201cFeeling a lot better now, but what a big player for us, showing up in the biggest moments. We rely on him a lot for the big moments.\u201d Much of the buildup to Tuesday\u2019s game between the US and Iran focused on the political tensions between the two nations.  Iran state media called for the US to be kicked out of the tournament after US Soccer changed Iran\u2019s flag on its social media accounts to show support for the protestors in Iran. The governing body told CNN that it wanted to change the official flag for 24 hours to show \u201csupport for the women in Iran fighting for basic human rights\u201d but always planned to go back to the original flag. Iran appeared at the World Cup under the shadow of domestic turmoil following widespread protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died after being detained by Iran\u2019s morality police, allegedly for not abiding by the country\u2019s conservative dress code. Iranian security forces have since unleashed a violent response to the protests. There are concerns about the safety of the Iranian players returning home after the team initially refused to sing Iran\u2019s national anthem before its first game in an apparent show of solidarity with demonstrators. The team\u2019s families were also threatened with imprisonment and torture in advance of the match, a source involved in the security of the games said. At the end Tuesday\u2019s game, players from the two teams embraced in an apparent show of solidarity.  US defender Antonee Robinson was seen embracing a visibly distraught Ramin Rezaeian, who cried as he was embraced by the Fulham player, and comforting Abolfazl Jalali, who knelt on the pitch after the match ended.  Meanwhile, Josh Sargent, DeAndre Yedlin and Timothy Weah crouched to comfort Saeid Ezatolahi, who had buried his head in his hands as he sat on the turf and processed his team\u2019s loss.  \u201cWe know first and foremost as competitors what it\u2019s like to lose,\u201d said Zimmerman. \u201cWe also know the stakes of a World Cup, and then on top of that everything that they\u2019re dealing with emotionally.  \u201cWe just congratulated them on their effort and empathized with them and let them know that we\u2019re proud of the way that they competed on the field in the game last night.\u201d CNN\u2019s Matt Foster, Issy Ronald and Sam Kiley contributed to reporting.

It\u2019s also further evidence of Russia\u2019s determination to root out what it sees as Western liberal values, coming in the same week Russia\u2019s parliament sent a bill expanding a ban on what it calls \u201cpropaganda\u201d of LGBT issues to Putin\u2019s desk. The 2012 law on Foreign Agents, passed after a wave of public protests against Putin\u2019s return to the presidency, required organizations engaging in political activity and receiving funding from abroad to register as foreign agents and adhere to draconian rules and restrictions. That law has been gradually updated since then, forming the backbone of an ever tighter stranglehold on civil society in Russia over the past decade. From Thursday that definition is expanded to include not only individuals or organizations receiving funding from abroad but those who have \u201creceived support and (or) is under foreign influence\u201d.   Further reading of the law does not offer much in terms of clarification. \u201cSupport\u201d by foreign sources is defined not just as financial but \u201corganizational and methodological, or scientific and technical help.\u201d \u201cInfluence\u201d can be read, according to the law, as \u201cexacting an influence on an individual by coercion, persuasion or other means.\u201d This is the point, says Konstantin Von Eggert, a freelance Russian journalist now living in Lithuania. Laws like this that make up what he calls \u201cPutin\u2019s repressive system\u201d are designed to be broad and vague, and selectively applied so as to \u201cscare and paralyze.\u201d  \u201cOnce the laws are applied across the board you might fairly quickly figure out how to game the system,\u201d he said. If the laws are \u201capplied in a haphazard way or readily, you don\u2019t know.\u201d Andrey Soldatov, another exiled Russian journalist, known for his investigative work on the Russian security services, says this is part of a crackdown directly correlated to Russia\u2019s defeats in Ukraine. \u201cYou cannot provide a really good narrative, an explanation why Kherson was given up,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe best way to do that is to add an element of fear.\u201d Intensifying crackdown The further erosion of free speech and democratic freedoms in Russia has gone hand in hand with what the Kremlin euphemistically refers to as the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine almost since the start. Within days of the invasion, Russia had restricted access to Facebook, some Western news sites, and independent media in the country. Peaceful protests were quickly shut down and thousands arrested. In early March, the government adopted a law criminalizing the dissemination of what it called \u201cdeliberately false\u201d information about the Russian armed forces. The maximum penalty is 15 years in prison. CNN and several other Western news organizations temporarily suspended broadcasting from Russia. The defense of \u201ctraditional values\u201d \u2013 part of Putin\u2019s case for launching the war in Ukraine \u2013 has also proved another pretext for greater repression at home since the invasion. In his speech on February 24th, the day the war started, Putin claimed the US and the West \u201csought to destroy our traditional values and force on us their false values that would erode us.\u201d  This week the speaker of Russia\u2019s lower house, the State Duma, said a new law expanding a 2013 ban on \u201cpropaganda\u201d of LGBT issues, pedophilia and gender reassignment to both minors and adults would \u201cprotect our children, the future of our country from the darkness spread by the United States and European states.\u201d Human Rights Watch warned the law would have an \u201ceven more stifling effect on freedom of expression, well-being and security.\u201d  The expanded foreign agent law is now an even more powerful tool in Russia\u2019s legislative tool box to bring its population in line with its goals. Any person or organization designated a foreign agent (a phrase that carries clear Soviet undertones in Russia) will be banned from many teaching jobs, won\u2019t be able to organize public events, or receive state funding for projects. The law also bans any material published by a foreign agent to be distributed to minors. It will be required to be marked with an 18+ stamp and sold in a sealed opaque package according to the State Duma.  And the Russian Justice ministry will now publish the personal data of designated foreign agents according to state media \u2013 not just names, and dates of birth but taxpayer identification numbers and individual insurance account numbers (similar to a social security number). Soldatov says the expanded law may be designed to target employees of state institutions.  \u201cIf you are put on this list it\u2019s not a big problem if you\u2019re just an ordinary guy,\u201d he says.  But if you\u2019re a \u201cdoctor or a teacher or a professor at some university that\u2019s where you find yourself in some really big trouble, because you lose your job and its really really hard.\u201d Von Eggert though believes the decision to expand the law now (it was signed by Putin in July) is telling in its futility. \u201cThey missed the moment and those who were really active and that posed any danger, they are either already jailed or they are abroad. So who are they threatening? I don\u2019t know.\u201d With Russia\u2019s efforts in Ukraine faltering, he sees the law as \u201ca sign of weakness rather than a sign of strength.\u201d "},

Pulisic was involved in a heavy collision with Iran goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand as he scored the US\u2019 winning goal on Tuesday, with the forward being sent to hospital during the game for what was initially described as an abdominal injury. The Chelsea forward told reporters at the pre-match press conference that it had now been diagnosed as a pelvic contusion and says he is taking the injury \u201cday by day.\u201d \u201cI will do everything in my power to work with this medical team and make sure that I can play,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get, like, hit in the balls,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m alright.

It would be a huge blow to the USMNT\u2019s chances if the 24-year-old is forced to miss the match against the Netherlands. Pulisic also went on to describe the unusual moment he was trying to keep track of the US score against Iran while being taken to hospital, calling it \u201ca crazy kind of experience.\u201d \u201cObviously, the emotions were running so high so I was like doing everything I could to continue playing and all was kind of a blur, to be honest,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut then once I was told I was being taken to the hospital, I had to get looked at, I was able to follow it on the guy\u2019s [medical trainer] with me, on his phone. \u201cIt was like the hardest thing. I think they were checking my blood sugar and everything and I was flying through the roof, but it wasn\u2019t because of anything, it was just me stress-watching the game. \u201cBut once I got through that and the final whistle blew, I was obviously very happy.\u201d Victory over the Netherlands would put the US in the quarterfinals for the first time since 2002 and almost \u2013 though perhaps not entirely \u2013 make up for the national team\u2019s failure to qualify for the World Cup four years ago."},

The nation was eliminated from the tournament in Qatar after its 1-0 loss on Tuesday, ending a campaign that has been overshadowed by anti-government protests that have raged for months at home. But there are concerns about the safety of the Iranian players returning home across the Persian Gulf, after the team initially refused to sing Iran\u2019s national anthem before their first game in an apparent show of solidarity with demonstrators. The team\u2019s families were also threatened with imprisonment and torture in advance of the match, a source involved in the security of the games said. People in several Iranian cities celebrated from inside their homes and residential buildings moments after the final whistle, which came in the early hours of Wednesday local time, while videos posted on social media showed people honking their car horns, chanting and whistling.  \u201cI am happy, this is the government losing to the people,\u201d one witness to celebrations in a city in the Kurdish region, who CNN is not naming for security concerns, told CNN on Wednesday.  The Norway-based Iranian rights group Hengaw posted several videos of similar scenes. \u201cPeople in Paveh are celebrating Iran\u2019s national team lose over America in World Cup in Qatar, they are chanting \u2018Down with Jash (traitors),\u201d Hengaw said in a post. Demonstrations have rocked Iran for several months, sparking a deadly clampdown from authorities. The nationwide uprising was first ignited by the death of Mahsa (also known as Zhina) Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman who died in mid-September after being detained by the country\u2019s morality police. Since then, protesters across Iran have coalesced around a range of grievances with the regime.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Chief, Volker Turk, has said that the country is in a \u201cfull-fledged human rights crisis\u201d as authorities crack down on the protests.  Football has become an increasingly heated flashpoint in recent weeks, with the World Cup throwing a global spotlight on the turmoil inside the country.  And fans following the team in Qatar have become increasingly conflicted about their support. \u201cOur team has been hijacked,\u201d longtime fan Farshad Soheil told CNN. \u201cIt no longer represents the people of Iran.\u201d  Soheili said Iran\u2019s regime has managed to politicize and weaponize the team, and was critical of the players for not making a grander statement about the protests. \u201cIt was a wasted historical opportunity,\u201d Soheili said.  Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s game, many supporters said they didn\u2019t want Iran to win. \u201cThe reason is not because of football reason, [but] because of political reasons,\u201d another fan called Farshid \u2013 who withheld his last name for security reasons \u2013 told CNN in Doha. \u201cI have mixed emotion(s) and feeling(s),\u201d Farshid said. \u201cI\u2019m a passionate supporter of Iran but today unfortunately I can\u2019t be supporter of the national team because of the current situation going on and the government trying to hijack the game and sport and using it as a platform to buy credibility and to show that everything is normal (with) what\u2019s going on in Iran.\u201d Farshid said a lot of pro-regime supporters have also attended Iran\u2019s World Cup games in Doha and created a very tense environment for other Iranian fans by attempting to interfere with their interviews with the media. Concerns over returning players Iran\u2019s national side would have progressed to the second round of the World Cup with a win or draw against the US, but the team will now travel home after its group stage exit.  \u201cI\u2019m really sorry on behalf of our players, our group, that we couldn\u2019t get our opportunity to qualify for the next round,\u201d midfielder Saeid Ezatolah told reporters after the game. \u201cI hope our fans and our people in Iran, they forgive us. And I feel just sorry, that\u2019s it.\u201d The team\u2019s return will be closely watched amid fears that the players could face retribution for a perceived brief show of support for the protests, which drew international attention and praise from human rights groups.  The country\u2019s flag and national anthem have been rejected by protesters as symbols of the current regime. And, following the refusal of Iranian players to sing Iran\u2019s national anthem in their opening match against England on November 21, a source involved in the security of the games told CNN that the players were called to a meeting with members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).  The source said that they were told that their families would face \u201cviolence and torture\u201d if they did not sing the national anthem or if they joined any political protest against the Tehran regime. The players sang the anthem on Tuesday, and before their second game against Wales last Friday, which saw 2-0 victory for Iran. Hours before the game kicked off on Tuesday, Iranian authorities said a former member of the national soccer team, Parviz Boroumand \u2013 who was arrested this month over criticism of the government \u2013 was released on bail, according to state news agency IRNA. Boroumand had been arrested in mid-November during protests in Tehran, Iranian media outlets reported. Earlier on Tuesday, Iranian-Kurdish footballer Voria Ghafouri was also released on bail. Iranian football legend Ali Karimi, sometimes referred to as the \u201cAsian Maradona,\u201d has meanwhile said he has received death threats through his family members after he vocally supported protests.   The government has described him as one of the \u201cmain leaders\u201d of the demonstrations, and issued a warrant for his arrest in early October charging him with \u201charmonizing with the enemy\u201d and \u201cencouraging riots,\u201d according to Iran\u2019s Supreme Council of the Judiciary, both charges that are punishable by death.

In what was a frustrating evening for the Red Devils, both Romelu Lukaku and Yannick Carrasco spurned good opportunities to score the goal which would have sent Belgium through.  As it was, the No. 2 ranked team in the world failed to make the breakthrough at the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium, meaning it won\u2019t be featuring in the knockout phase of the tournament. Morocco \u2013 which won its game against Canada on Thursday 2-1 \u2013 and Croatia qualified from the group, finishing first and second respectively. For Belgium, it is another disappointing end to an international tournament and the Royal Belgian Football Association announced shortly afterward that manager Roberto Mart\u00ednez had stepped down from his role as national team coach.  In his post-match interview, Mart\u00ednez said that Belgium can go home with its \u201cheads held high.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to win games in the World Cup. We weren\u2019t ourselves in first game, we had a deserved defeat in the second game,\u201d Mart\u00ednez told the BBC.  \u201cToday, we were ready, we created opportunities and, today, there is no regrets. We\u2019re out, but we can leave with our heads held high.\u201d  End of an era? It was meant to be the last dance for the so-called \u2018golden generation\u2019 of Belgium. With many of its squad approaching or in their mid-30s \u2013 including Dries Mertens, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld \u2013 the World Cup in Qatar was seen by many as a final opportunity to get over the hump and win an international football title. But although the squad was packed full of top-level players, the age profile of the team led some to believe that Belgium\u2019s window had passed.  In fact, Belgium\u2019s star midfielder Kevin De Bruyne said in an interview with the Guardian that his side had \u201cno chance\u201d to win the title because the players are \u201ctoo old.\u201d And, needing a win in its final Group F game against Croatia to advance, Belgium\u2019s weaknesses were clear to see in a slow-paced first half.  The team had a lot of possession without ever really breaking down an organized Croatia while also looking vulnerable on the break.  The biggest talking point of the half came midway through when Croatia thought it had a penalty \u2013 2018 Ballon d\u2019Or winner Luka Modri\u0107 had even placed the ball on the spot \u2013 only for referee Anthony Taylor to eventually rule out the spot kick for offside after a video assistant referee (VAR) review.  After the break and following the introduction of Lukaku, Belgium increased the tempo as it pressed for a vital goal \u2013 the Inter Milan striker heading straight into the arms of Croatia goalkeeper Dominik Livakovi\u0107.  Seconds later though, it was Croatia who had a good chance; Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107\u2019s curled effort tipped away by Thibaut Courtois.  Despite Belgium being the team needing all three points, it was Croatia who ramped up the pressure. Courtois, playing in his 100th game for Belgium, had to be at his best to deny both Modri\u0107 and Marcelo Brozovi\u0107.  Belgium nearly got the all-important breakthrough on the hour mark when Carrasco was denied by heroic block from a defender before Lukaku hit the post when he likely should have scored.  ust minutes later, Lukaku missed another glorious opportunity as he headed over from close range \u2013 the ball looked to have gone out moments before De Bruyne crossed it so the effort likely would have been ruled out. As time ticked away, Belgium had two massive opportunities to rescue a victory.  In added time, Lukaku \u2013 with the goal at his mercy \u2013 could not sort his feet out and his weak effort was eventually gathered by the goalkeeper near the goal line. And in the final few seconds, when it looked like Belgium would have one final chance, a superb recovery tackle from 20-year-old Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol saved the day for the Croatians. It huffed and puffed, but Belgium could not find the vital goal. Afterwards, Mart\u00ednez was asked about if this marks the end for the country\u2019s \u2018golden generation\u2019 and the Spaniard was philosophical.  \u201cYou see Youri Tielemans and other young players \u2013 the \u2018golden generation\u2019 is doing something that is bringing the next generation on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what names are on the pitch, the legacy can be left in many ways.\u201d Mart\u00ednez added when asked if the result was a disappointment: \u201cWe wanted to get through but I\u2019m sure the other national teams wanted to get through and that\u2019s the tournament.  \u201cIn the previous World Cup, we won three games in the group stage, we wanted to go all the way.\u201d"},

It\u2019s asked about every single day. \u201cIt seems like to me that whole Jerry Jones situation photo \u2013 and I know it was years and years ago and we all mistakes, I get it,\u201d the 37-year-old James continued. \u201cBut we \u2026 just move on. When asked about the photo after it was published by the Washington Post, Jones told reporters he was a curious kid and that he didn\u2019t know how monumental the event really was. \u201cI didn\u2019t know at the time the monumental event really that was going on,\u201d Jones said, according to ESPN. \u201cI\u2019m sure glad that we\u2019re a long way from that. I am. That would remind me [to] just continue to do everything we can to not have those kinds of things happen.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Dallas Cowboys and the Los Angeles Lakers for comment.  Outspoken about social justice Five-time NBA champion James was asked about Irving in November and said: \u201cI believe what Kyrie did caused some harm to a lot of people. He has since, over the last \u2013 today, or was it yesterday \u2013 he apologized. But he caused some harm. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what color your skin is, how tall you are, what position you\u2019re in \u2013 if you are promoting or soliciting, or saying harmful things to any community that harm people, then I don\u2019t respect it. I don\u2019t condone it.\u201d James was once an avid Dallas Cowboys fan, but recently said he switched his allegiance to the Cleveland Browns following the Cowboys\u2019 policy \u2013 iterated by Jones \u2013 that players stand for the national anthem as players across the country were taking the knee to protest social and racial injustice. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of things that was going on during the, you know, when guys were kneeling,\u201d James said during an Instagram Live conversation with Maverick Carter, who is the NBA star\u2019s long-time friend and business partner. \u201cA lot of people in their front office and a lot of people that ran the organization was like, \u2018If you do that around here, you will never play for this franchise again.\u2019 I just didn\u2019t think that was appropriate.\u201d In 2018, Jones told reporters: \u201cOur policy is that you stand at the anthem, toe on the line.\u201d  James has long been outspoken about social justice, and co-founded voting rights organization \u201cMore Than a Vote\u201d along with a host of other Black athletes and artists to focus on combating systemic, racist voter suppression."},

In just 31 minutes on the court, the shooting guard shot 20-for-25 from the field and went 6-for-7 from deep, making it one of the most efficient scoring performances in NBA history. According to ESPN Stats and Info, he became only the second player in the last 25 years to score 50 points with 80% shooting accuracy in the first three quarters of a game along with James Harden in November 2017. \u201cIt felt like a double-sized rim out there,\u201d Booker said after the game. \u201cIf I rise up, it\u2019s going in.\u201d The 26-year-old guard and center Deandre Ayton \u2013 who finished with 30 points and 14 rebounds \u2013 dominated the first half, combining for 41 points and giving the Suns a 21-point halftime lead.  In the third, Booker took it to another gear, dropping 26 points to kill the game off \u2013 shooting 10-for-11 in the quarter.  Booker was on fire despite the Bulls\u2019 best efforts, ending the third quarter with a run of nine consecutive points including a dunk, a 29-foot triple and a four-point play. After he had won the game for the Suns in the third quarter, Booker was pulled for the rest of the game, but he did apparently have the option to keep piling up the points. \u201cCoach [Monty Williams] tried to put me in when they cut it to 18 \u2026 I didn\u2019t think it was necessary,\u201d Booker said after the game. Suns coach Williams said, \u201cThere\u2019s not a level where he can\u2019t score. \u201cHe can use both hands, he can score with a hand in his face and he\u2019s willing to take the tough shots.\u201d Bulls guard Zach LaVine, who finished with 21 points and seven assists, agreed, \u201cA guy like that gets in a rhythm and it\u2019s too late. He gets it going and it\u2019s over.\u201d Booker now has back-to-back 40-point games after scoring 44 against the Sacramento Kings and is making his case as an early MVP candidate. The win takes the Suns to the top of the Western Conference at 15-6, a record bolstered by a 12-1 tally at home. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many sellout crowds that is in a row, but it\u2019s impressive,\u201d Booker said on the support in the Footprint Center.  \u201cMondays, Tuesdays, Saturdays, it doesn\u2019t matter what day of the week it is. They show up and show out.\u201d But much of that success is down to Booker, who in this game took advantage of slack Bulls\u2019 defending to continue his hot streak and is now averaging just under 28 points per game. \u201cWe threw everything at him,\u201d Bulls coach Billy Donovan said on Booker. \u201cWe trapped him, we threw a box and one at him. We tried to face guard him and to his credit had had a great night.\u201d Fans were chanting, \u201cMVP! MVP!\u201d after Booker sunk a three-pointer in the third quarter. It might be a bit too early for that, but if Booker keeps on racking up numbers like he did tonight, he will become hard to ignore as the season progresses."}
