But that\u2019s when we started paying attention that something might be happening. ", "We\u2019re used to covering companies buying other companies. But we\u2019re not used to covering people buying companies so much, and certainly not the world\u2019s richest man buying this communications ecosystem that hundreds of millions of people depend on. So it wasn\u2019t just a business story or a mergers and acquisitions story. It symbolizes so much of what\u2019s going on in tech, and online speech, and also in the economy and who has power in this world. I couldn\u2019t look away. By the end of the summer, things were changing almost daily. We had to cover it as a news story, but at the same time, we were covering this thing on Twitter. Journalists have a very special relationship with Twitter, for better and for worse. We communicate on it. We see what other people are up to. We look for sources. It\u2019s huge. So sometimes it felt like a little bit like the rug was being pulled out from under us. ", "There\u2019s a lot of chaos. There\u2019s a lot of noise. It\u2019s very easy to fall into just covering the loudest voices or the biggest storyline. So we made a decision pretty early on to focus on the people who use Twitter. And I think that that resulted in a lot of interesting stories. For us, it was important to take a step back so that we didn\u2019t just become his megaphone \u2014 like \u201cMusk did this,\u201d \u201cMusk said that,\u201d because also he was changing his mind so quickly. He would say one thing one day, and then turn around and say something the opposite the next day. So you have to put it in context. And we can also cover it in a way like: Who is who is affected by the rise of extremism on Twitter? What does that do to people? How does that actually silence speech? ", "One thing that\u2019s important to understand is that Twitter is not just in the United States. The majority of its users are not even in the U.S. So right now, a lot of the chatter about Twitter is very much focused on U.S. politics and the U.S. differences between the left and right. And 80% of Twitter users are outside of the U.S. I\u2019m willing to go out on a limb that they do not care about, or know about, Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop or conservative speech suppression. So even though the loudest voices on Twitter that we can see have been focused on this story, for us it\u2019s important to take a step back and understand that most of most of the people who use Twitter, you know, are not us. And they don\u2019t care about the same things that we do. And yet Twitter is really important to them, probably maybe even more important than it is to us. ", "We\u2019ve all spent so much time ragging on Twitter and not really liking Twitter. I remember the night that that Elon Musk laid off half of Twitter, and people started quitting or looking for other platforms to go to \u2014 places like Mastodon, which is another social media platform. I started losing followers, people who left. I didn\u2019t realize until then how much Twitter actually mattered to me. And I think that might be true for other people on the platform, too. ", "It has been, it still is, a community \u2014 many communities tied together. And despite a lot of other social media sites popping up right now, there\u2019s really nothing else quite like it. I think Elon Musk realized that when he decided to buy it. I will tell you what I think is special about it: the people on it. And a huge part of that is just the diversity of countries and people and regions. And anything that\u2019s coming up right now to replace it is way more siloed. If this goes, I\u2019m not sure if if anything will replace it in the same way.", "___", "2022 Notebooks: https://apnews.com/hub/reporters-notebook"]},

Much like the ocean, soil and forests, whales can help save humanity from the accelerating climate crisis by sequestering and storing planet-heating carbon emissions, researchers say.  In a paper published Thursday in the journal Trends in Ecology & Evolution, climate researchers suggest that whales are important, but often overlooked, carbon sinks. The enormous size of these marine mammals, which can reach 150 tons, means they can store carbon much more effectively than smaller animals.  And because whales live longer than most animals, some for more than 100 years, the paper said they could be \u201cone of the largest stable living carbon pools\u201d in the ocean. Even when they die, whale carcasses descend to the deepest parts of the sea and settle on the seafloor, trapping the carbon they\u2019ve stored in their stout, protein-rich bodies.   An indirect way whales can be critical carbon sinks is through their feces. Whale poop is rich in nutrients which can be taken up by phytoplankton \u2014 tiny organisms that suck up carbon dioxide as they grow.  When they die, phytoplankton also sink at the bottom of the seafloor, taking tiny bits of carbon in their carcasses.  The process of carbon sequestration helps mitigate climate change, because it locks away carbon that otherwise would have warmed the planet somewhere else for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.   Yet whales are threatened, with six out of 13 great whale species classified as endangered or vulnerable due to threats including industrial whaling, which has reduced whale biomass by 81%, as well as entanglement with fishing gear, climate change-induced shifts in prey availability, noise pollution and more.  Heidi Pearson, lead author and researcher at the University of Alaska Southeast, said the research shows that protecting whales has a double benefit \u2014 helping to stem the biodiversity crisis as well as human-caused climate change.    The paper puts together all available research about how whales work as critical carbon sinks. As the need grows for nature-based solutions such as tree planting to help solve the climate crisis, Pearson said it is important to understand the ability of whales to trap carbon.  \u201cYou can think of protecting whales as a low risk and low regret strategy, because there\u2019s really no downside,\u201d Pearson told CNN. \u201cWhat if we protect them and get ecosystem benefits in addition to carbon?\u201d She said there was no risk to this strategy compared to other untested, expensive solutions to capturing and trapping carbon, such as geoengineering. There has been much research and analysis into whales\u2019 contribution to carbon storage over the years.  In 2019, economists with the International Monetary Fund attempted to quantify the economic benefits of whales. The first-of-its-kind analysis looked at the market price of carbon dioxide, then calculated the whale\u2019s total monetary value based on how much carbon it captures, in addition to other economic benefits like ecotourism. It put the average value of a great whale at $2 million.  But there remain big gaps in knowledge to fully determine how whale carbon should be used in climate mitigation policies. Asha de Vos, a marine biologist and founder of Oceanswell in Sri Lanka, said it\u2019s important to recognize that whales have \u201cmore to offer than their beauty and charisma,\u201d and that protecting them is key to a proper functioning ocean ecosystem.   \u201cBut, as the authors suggest, we mustn\u2019t overemphasize the role of whales in these spaces as we do not have sufficient research,\u201d de Vos, who is not involved with the study, told CNN. \u201cFundamentally, whales will not save our oceans or planet on their own, but they likely play a role in the larger system.\u201d  As Pearson continues to research whale carbon in Alaska, particularly delving into the indirect pathways in which whales can be carbon sinks, she said she hopes the current paper pushes policymakers to consider whales as a significant part of climate mitigation strategies.   It\u2019s another layer that links the biodiversity crisis to the climate crisis \u2014 but for now, Pearson said she and a team will go back out in the field to fully quantify the carbon impact of whales.   \u201cWhales aren\u2019t a silver bullet to saving the planet; it\u2019s just one small thing that we could do amidst many other things we need to do for climate change,\u201d Pearson said. \u201cWe just need to get the scientific story straight.\u201d "},

Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit. \u201cThe world is your oyster when you are educated\u201d Cheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. \u201cI know the pain of poverty,\u201d said Cheboi, 29. \u201cI never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.\u201d A hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop.  Everything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major. \u201cWhen I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,\u201d she told CNN. Many basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum. \u201cI feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,\u201d she said. Once she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which  computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure. \u201cWe have kids here (in Kenya) \u2014 myself included, back in the day \u2014 who don\u2019t even know what a computer is,\u201d she said. So, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya \u2014 in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself. \u201cAt one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,\u201d she said. A year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals. The hardware is wiped and refurbished before it\u2019s shipped to Kenya. There, it\u2019s distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs. \u201cWe have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,\u201d Cheboi said. \u201cThey can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.\u201d The organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more. \u201cMy hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they\u2019re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,\u201d Cheboi said. \u201cThe world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.\u201d  An inspiring night of heroism and advocacy CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and ABC\u2019s Kelly Ripa co-hosted the 16th Annual \u201cCNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,\u201d which featured more than a dozen celebrity presenters. \u201cWe\u2019re so deeply honored to be here,\u201d said actress and singer Sofia Carson, who perfomed a song with award-winning songwriter Diane Warren at the event. \u201cDiane wrote this incredible anthem \u2018Applause\u2019 for those leading, surviving and fighting and tonight we dedicate this song and performance to our heroes.\u201d  Actor Aubrey Plaza introduced CNN Hero Aidan Reilly, who launched his nonprofit while home from college during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cFrom his pandemic couch, Aidan and his friends co-founded Farmlink Project,\u201d Plaza said. The nonprofit connects excess food from farms across the US \u2013 food that would otherwise be wasted \u2013 to those who need it. \u201cIn just two years, he .. has moved more than 70 million pounds,\u201d Plaza added.  Debra Vines \u2013 whose nonprofit The Answer Inc. supports families impacted by autism in underserved communities across Chicago \u2013 was honored by actress Holly Robinson Peete, a \u201cfellow autism mom.\u201d Vines says her group has provided programming and guidance to more than 4,000 families. \u201cJoin me and be a servant for the change today,\u201d Vines said when accepting her award. And Emmy award-winning actor Justin Theroux brought his rescue dog Kuma, on the stage to honor Carie Broecker \u200b\u200band her nonprofit, Peace of Mind Dog Rescue. Two teenagers making a difference in their communities were also honored as 2022 Young Wonders: Ruby Chitsey, a 15-year-old from Harrison, Arkansas, started \u201cThree Wishes for Ruby\u2019s Residents,\u201d which donates personal items to nursing home residents who couldn\u2019t otherwise afford them. Sri Nihal Tammana, a 13-year-old from Edison, New Jersey, started \u201cRecycle My Battery,\u201d which keeps used batteries out of the ecosystem through a network of collection bins. The show also honored two Georgia poll workers, Shaye Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, whose lives were upended after false allegations that they had been involved in election fraud spread on social media.

A year ago, Baker announced he would not seek re-election in 2022 for a third term as governor. Baker succeeds long-time president Mark Emmert. In June, Emmert announced he would step down from his role.

Joyce DeFauw, then Joyce Viola Kane, started her freshman year at Northern Illinois University in 1951 with a plan to graduate with a degree in home economics. But those plans changed when DeFauw met a special man at church who stole her heart, she told CNN Thursday.  \u201cI went to school for three and a half years, but decided to leave after I met him.\u201d DeFauw said.  The special man was Don Freeman Sr. The two got married in 1955, and had three children together before Freeman passed away, leaving her widowed for about five years. DeFauw eventually got remarried to her late second husband, Roy DeFauw. Together they had six children, including two sets of twins. Throughout the years her family grew, and she now has 17 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren. Flash forward to 2019 when DeFauw showed interest in the college education she left behind. \u201cI guess I mentioned I was upset that I didn\u2019t finish school and my children encouraged me to go back,\u201d she said, so she enrolled back at Northern Illinois and began taking classes.  Jenna Dooley, one of DeFauw\u2019s 17 grandchildren and an alumnus of NIU, told CNN it was more about the \u2018why not\u2019 versus the \u2018why\u2019, when DeFauw decided to go back. Dooley said when she was growing up she\u2019d visit her grandmother in her farmhouse where DeFauw would always be baking or cooking. DeFauw used to be a Sunday school teacher as well. \u201cShe\u2019s always had that love of teaching and learning,\u201d Dooley said. \u201cWhen we made calls to the school about a previous enrollment, they were shocked to hear we were asking about a student from the 50s,\u201d Dooley said. But this time around, things were much different for DeFauw. Instead of walking to campus to attend class, she did so behind a computer screen from her retirement home. \u201cIt was my first computer,\u201d DeFauw said, \u201cMy children had to teach me how to use it.\u201d  Dooley added her uncle Don, DeFauw\u2019s oldest son, helped set up the computer, get a camera for the computer and taught her how to navigate her school email. When the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020, she was thankful for the computer, Dooley said. \u201cIt worked out really well that she was already set up online,\u201d She added. She was on her own during that time and could have no visitors, Dooley said. \u201cAt times she\u2019d get frustrated, but I kept reminding her that this was all a part of the process.\u201d She added. \u201cAt times I wanted to quit, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d DeFauw said. She said she had plenty of encouragement from family, friends and the school. Director of Bachelor General Studies, Judy Santacaterina, was a huge help for DeFauw. Dooley said she took on the role of helping her grandmother get her degree and the entire family is grateful for Santacaterina. DeFauw took one class each semester, including during the summer. \u201cShe\u2019s very organized,\u201d Dooley said, \u201cShe has a routine. She wanted to keep taking classes so she wouldn\u2019t fall out of that routine.\u201d Now, three years later, she\u2019ll put on the cap and gown and receive a Bachelor of General Studies degree from the university this weekend. DeFauw is thankful she had the opportunity to get to go back to school and get her degree. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finish something you started,\u201d she said. Her piece of advice to those who may be in a similar situation: \u201cDon\u2019t give up,\u201d she said, \u201cI know it can be difficult, but everything in life has its ups and downs.\u201d \u201cShe has a gift of learning and teaching, so to be able to celebrate this with joy is the icing on the cake.\u201d Dooley said."},

People dying of hunger, brutal killings and many other horrific events that he covered as an international reporter unfolded right before his eyes.", "date": "2022-12-03", "author": "Tricia Escobedo", "text": "Gary Strieker had every reason to be a pessimist. People dying of hunger, brutal killings and many other horrific events that he covered as an international reporter unfolded right before his eyes.  Yet Strieker never lost his optimistic spirit or his passion to shed light on critically important but often underreported stories on the environment and global health. Strieker \u2014 who passed away in July of this year at age 78 \u2014 was CNN\u2019s first Nairobi bureau chief, helping the network open its reporting hub in the Kenyan capital in 1985. Colleagues say he covered the entire African continent \u2014 sometimes as a one-man band \u2014 during the network\u2019s early years when newsgathering budgets were lean. \u201cHe was passionate about (Africa) and he wanted to share that love of the continent with all its craziness and violence, but also its beauty and fun,\u201d said Kim Norgaard, CNN\u2019s senior director of operations for international newsgathering. Strieker won an Emmy award in 1992 for his role in CNN\u2019s coverage of Somalia\u2019s civil war and he is credited with being one of the first television journalists to enter Rwanda as the genocide unfolded there in the spring of 1994.  He spent the latter part of his career focusing on global environmental issues \u2014 most recently producing \u201cThis American Land\u201d which airs on PBS stations across the US.  This career shift came about in the mid-1990s after an encounter with Ted Turner, CNN\u2019s founder, who shared Strieker\u2019s passion about conservation and the environment.  \u201c(Gary) had this idea he wanted to be CNN\u2019s environmental reporter,\u201d said Norgaard. \u201cEvery year or so we had (a) conference in Atlanta and I walked down there with Gary and I hear Ted yell, \u2018Gary! Come sit here!\u2019 and he announces to everyone, \u2018Gary is our guy in Africa!\u2019   \u201cThey sat down and started talking and then Gary just mentioned this idea to him about environmental (reporting) and I remember Ted turning around, looking at Tom Johnson (CNN\u2019s president at the time) and going, \u2018Tom, this is brilliant! I love it, let\u2019s make it happen!\u201d Other colleagues who recalled the story said Johnson later half-jokingly swore never to sit a correspondent next to Turner again.  In 1997, Strieker and his second wife Christine moved to Atlanta where he worked as CNN\u2019s global environment correspondent.  His reporting on central Africa\u2019s bushmeat crisis, as well as deforestation in Indonesia, Peru and Papua New Guinea, earned him the National Press Club\u2019s top prize for environmental reporting in 2000.  \u201cGary was, in a lot of ways, ahead of his time \u2014 he was pushing for environmental reporting years before any other network,\u201d Norgaard recalled.  Norgaard, CNN\u2019s former Johannesburg bureau chief, was a junior editor on the network\u2019s international desk in Atlanta when he first began working with Strieker.   \u201cI was born and grew up in Africa, so we kind of had a special understanding,\u201d he said.  Strieker was different than many international correspondents at the time who, Norgaard said, could be \u201creally wound-up\u201d and rude when they called the international desk. \u201cThat was never him,\u201d Norgaard said.  \u201cHe was always calm, courteous \u2026 that\u2019s what I will never forget about Gary. I didn\u2019t know him that closely, but he\u2019s someone you considered a friend.\u201d A remarkable storyteller Born in the small Illinois town of Breese on July 7, 1944, Strieker grew up in San Diego, California \u2013 eventually earning a law degree from UC-Hastings in San Francisco. Strieker and his first wife, Phyllis, joined one of the first US Peace Corps teams in 1968 on a mission to the newly independent African Kingdom of Swaziland \u2013 now Eswatini. Strieker spent five years in Swaziland serving as a legal advisor to the new sovereign government and helping draft a bill to protect Swazi land rights. During this time, his eldest daughter Lindsay was born. Strieker took a job with Citibank in Beirut in 1975 during the early days of the Lebanese civil war before returning to Africa as Citibank\u2019s resident vice president for its regional office in Nairobi, Kenya.  Strieker\u2019s twin daughters, Rachel and Alison, were born in Nairobi, and some health complications put Alison\u2019s life at risk.  \u201cThe doctor at the hospital who was taking care of me was just very nonchalant and said, \u2018Well \u2026 we\u2019ll see if she makes it through the night,\u2019\u201d said Alison Strieker, recalling her dad\u2019s story. \u201cAnd my dad said, \u2018Is there something we can do?\u2019 and the doctor said \u2018She needs blood for a transfusion.\u2019\u201d Gary Strieker said he asked the nurses to test his blood type and he was a match. Years later, Alison said her dad saved her life a second time when he donated his kidney to her. \u201cHe\u2019s my favorite person on earth,\u201d Alison Strieker said. \u201cI still have his kidney to this day.\u201d As his daughters were growing up, they were the center of his life and he captured many moments of their young lives on a movie camera and an old Kodak \u201cBrownie\u201d camera.  His passion for photography sparked his pivot to journalism.   \u201cThe photography mainly got him interested in not just the images but telling a story \u2026 about people and places and animals that do not have a voice \u2014 and that seemed to be his real passion,\u201d Alison Strieker recalled. After a brief stint with ABC News, he joined CNN in the early 1980s, setting up the new network\u2019s bureau in Nairobi and becoming its only correspondent on the African continent at the time.    \u201cGary entered the world of reporting in countries in Africa at a time in the 1980s when long-running conflicts in Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia coincided with drought and famine (and) led to large refugee crises,\u201d former CNN supervising editor Eli Flournoy recalled.  \u201cGary was there on the ground, year after year, covering, documenting, illustrating these endemic conflicts.\u201d  Strieker had a lot of close calls during his reporting career. \u201cHe was in crash landings in planes, he was in car accidents where other people died \u2014 he was just very dedicated,\u201d his oldest daughter Lindsay Strieker said. After a car accident in Rwanda, he was declared dead and taken to the morgue.  \u201cHe woke up in the morgue as a toe tag was being attached and said it damn near killed the medical worker when he sat up,\u201d recalled Jim Clancy, former CNN anchor and international correspondent.  He had another brush with death while reporting on the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo, that left hundreds dead. \u201cGary \u2026 fearlessly went in and covered the Ebola patients and the operations of the (Kikwit) hospital, which was one of the first of its kind to treat an infectious outbreak like Ebola,\u201d Flournoy recalled. \u201cIt was a very, very dangerous environment.\u201d At one point, the local authorities began implementing a quarantine and approached Strieker, who they believed had been exposed to Ebola.   \u201cThey were going to put him in the hospital\u2019s Ebola wing,\u201d Flournoy said.   Equipped with a satellite phone, Strieker called the international desk in a panic.  \u201cHe (said) \u2018We have to do something to prevent this from happening, because I will almost certainly die if I\u2019m quarantined in this hospital,\u2019\u201d Flournoy said. After a \u201cmad scramble\u201d which involved lots of phone calls and the intervention of United Nations officials, Strieker was allowed to leave the country instead.   \u201cGary continued to be unflappable, determined to get down to the facts of the story at the same time as being able to always find the human story within the larger conflict,\u201d Flournoy said. \u201cHe was a remarkable storyteller.\u201d \u2018If I don\u2019t go, nobody\u2019s doing those stories\u2019 Strieker never lost his curiosity or energy for shining a light on critical stories about people who are impacted by global health and environmental crises.   \u201cIt was never about getting his face on TV or a higher Nielsen rating,\u201d said Dave Timko who worked with Strieker on \u201cThis American Land.\u201d  Strieker only cared about using his platforms to tell the stories of people across the world who were in need. \u201cSometimes he\u2019d say, \u2018If I don\u2019t go to those places, nobody\u2019s doing those stories,\u2019\u201d his widow Christine Nkini Strieker said. He was a devoted father to the couple\u2019s two children Reid, 20, and Nandi, 16, sharing stories with them at dinnertime about his adventures and spending every moment he could with his family when he wasn\u2019t on assignment. Even when he became ill, Christine said that Strieker was determined to get better so he could start working again. \u201cHe refused to say, I\u2019m too sick to do anything,\u201d she said.    After Strieker\u2019s passing in July, friends and former colleagues flooded a shared Facebook page with memories \u2014 all recounting Strieker\u2019s incredible stories, his quiet bravery in the midst of incredibly dangerous reporting assignments, his wit and genuine devotion to the craft of journalism. \u201cHis message to us was, \u2018Life, with its ups and downs, is an adventure \u2013 and it\u2019s important to stay curious and compassionate,\u2019\u201d said his daughter Rachel.

The storm already brought avalanche warnings to parts of the West, shutting down major highways as conditions became icy. Almost 15 million people in over a dozen states are under some level of winter weather alert as the powerful storm moves across the county, bringing with it a multiday severe storm threat. Sign up to receive weekly email updates from CNN Meteorologists. Blinding blizzard conditions The storm will strengthen as it travels eastward, bringing snow to the Rockies tonight, where a foot of snow is expected before the system strengthens even more.  The Upper Midwest, and northern and central Plains will get hit the hardest Monday night into Tuesday as widespread heavy snow falls. \u201cSnow accumulations through Tuesday morning will generally range between 6 to 12 inches, centered on the Northern High Plains,\u201d the US weather prediction center said. \u201cThe highest snow totals are currently forecast for western South Dakota and northwestern Nebraska, where upwards of 18 to 24 inches is possible.\u201d   Meanwhile, a widespread area from eastern Wyoming and Colorado to western South Dakota and Nebraska will also have winds gusts as high as 60 mph. Heavy snowfall and strong winds will set the stage for a blizzard, leading to whiteout conditions and impossible travel. Blizzard conditions are when there are sustained winds of 35 mph or higher and visibility below a quarter mile for at least three consecutive hours. Winter storm alerts stretch from the Canadian border to the Mexican border and blizzard warnings extend from just west of Denver into the Dakotas. \u201cAll preparations for this storm should be well underway and completed sooner rather than later,\u201d the National Weather Service office in Rapid City said.   Some locales inside the blizzard warning areas could pick up as much as 20 inches of snow. The winds could be strong enough to knock down tree limbs and cause power outages, and the harsh conditions could be deadly for anyone outdoors.  \u201cThe cold wind chills, as low as 20 below zero, could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes,\u201d the weather service office in Cheyenne, Wyoming, said.  Farther east, ice warnings blanket eastern North Dakota, where nearly half an inch of ice could accumulate. If it materializes, power outages are certain and travel will be impossible. Icing is also possible across southwestern Minnesota and western Iowa, where as much as a tenth of an inch of ice could develop. Even Anchorage schools are closed While the Anchorage school district builds two snow days into the calendar, the system has been closed for four. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual. Unsafe road conditions have prevented us from returning to school,\u201d Anchorage School District spokesperson MJ Thim said. The current snow depth in Anchorage, Alaska, is 31 inches, making it the greatest since March 27, 2012, according to a tweet from Alaska climate scientist Brian Brettschneider.  Between 12 and 24 inches of snow fell in the region Sunday into Monday morning, according to the National Weather Service. It was second significant snow storm in less than a week.   Thim said officials are looking at their options, including remote learning, depending on future snowfall totals. Multiday severe storm threat While the storm brings whiteout conditions to the North, the southern section of the storm will have the potential to bring late-season tornadoes along with strong thunderstorms.  On Monday evening, storms will fire up across western Kansas, as well as across portions of Texas and Oklahoma. The Storm Prediction Center is expecting storms to rapidly develop tonight, after dark. A Level 2 of 5 risk of severe weather has been issued for the area, including Oklahoma City and Norman in Oklahoma as well as Colby and Garden City in Kansas, and Wichita Falls in Texas. \u201cOccasional damaging winds, isolated large hail, and a couple of tornadoes will be possible tonight,\u201d the Storm Prediction Center said.  Track the storms as they develop here. As the storm system strengthens and pushes eastward on Tuesday, the possibility of damaging winds, hail, flash flooding and even strong tornadoes will be a concern for portions of the Deep South, especially central Louisiana and eastern Texas.  \u201cAll modes of severe will be possible with damaging winds, hail and some more late fall tornadoes,\u201d the weather service office in Shreveport said.  Shreveport, Monroe and Alexandria in Louisiana are in a Level 3 of 5 risk for severe weather. Dallas, Fort Worth, and New Orleans are under a Level 2 risk.  \u201cA couple of strong tornadoes will be possible, especially with any isolated storms which can develop just ahead of the main convective band,\u201d the Storm Prediction Center said.  By Wednesday, the storms are not expected to be quite as intense, but could still be strong along the Gulf Coast. New Orleans, Mobile and Tallahassee are all under a Level 2 of 5 risk of severe weather, as the potential for tornadoes will still exist.  Very heavy rain will also be of concern as several inches of rain could fall in a short amount of time within some of the heaviest downpours.  There is a Level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall focused across the Lower Mississippi River Valley as rainfall amounts could top 4 inches, leading to isolated pockets of flash flooding.  The area has been starving for rain as the Mississippi River has seen some of the lowest water levels on record this fall. The rain this week could actually help the gauge near Memphis get above low water stage for the first time since mid-August. The slight bump in water level is only expected to be temporary, but it\u2019s a positive sign moving forward. \u2018It looks a lot like Christmas out here\u2019 The storm already made for icy and dangerous conditions on key roadways, with authorities on Saturday closing down a long stretch of Interstate 80, from Colfax in Northern California to Stateline, Nevada, due to \u201cblowing snow & near-zero visibility,\u201d Caltrans, the state transportation agency, said on Twitter. In the Sierra Nevada, snowpack totals are already above average, according to the National Weather Service in Reno. \u201cThe snowpack is about 225% of normal, so it\u2019s more than twice what we\u2019d be expecting this time in December,\u201d said Mark Deutschendorf, forecaster at the National Weather Service office in Reno. The Tahoe Basin and the Eastern Sierra are seeing snowfall totals which are typically recorded in January. The storm blanketed some mountain areas of drought-parched California with thick snow, including Soda Springs in the northern part of the state, which received 60 inches of snow in just 48 hours. \u201cIt looks a lot like Christmas out here,\u201d Deutschendorf said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come with a lot of wind, and it stuck to everything. It\u2019s like a picture postcard.\u201d  While he noted the snow totals so far are impressive, Deutschendorf said he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about this precipitation putting a big dent in the state\u2019s drought. \u201cWe had a similar run of storms last year. We had a nice head start, and then January through March were incredibly dry,\u201d Deutschendorf explained. In California over the weekend, 48 inches of snow fell in Twin Bridges in a 48-hour period, 46 inches fell in Tahoe-Donner, 45 inches in Donner Peak and 44 inches at Palsades Tahoe Ski Base. \u201cWe\u2019re Buried,\u201d the Palisades Tahoe Ski Resort wrote on its website Sunday, sharing photos of thick snow covering the ski resort in Olympic Valley, California. \u201cThis is definitely a storm to remember. We\u2019ve now received 7.5 feet of snow since December 1st. Plus, in just 24 hours from Saturday morning to Sunday morning, we received more than 35 inches of snow \u2014 the 6th largest snowfall total in 24 hours that we have on record,\u201d resort operators wrote.

Boluarte became Peru\u2019s first female president last week after lawmakers removed her predecessor Pedro Castillo. She initially ruled out early elections last week, but protests calling for political change have ensued around the country, leaving at least two people dead and prompting the United Nations Human Rights Office to air its concern about escalated tensions. \u201cWith violence increasing as protests continue in Peru, we are deeply concerned that the situation may escalate further,\u201d its spokesperson Marta Hurtado said. \u201cGiven the number of protests, including strikes, planned for this week, we call on all involved to exercise restraint.\u201d  Since last week, protests erupted in cities across the country in support of Castillo, who is currently under a seven-day preliminary arrest ordered by Peru\u2019s Supreme Court and has not accepted his removal, calling Boluarte an \u201cusurper.\u201d  Demonstrators have called for another general election, the dissolution of Congress, and the creation of a new constituent assembly, according to the radio and television broadcaster Radio Programas del Per\u00fa. On Saturday, protesters also demonstrated in the city of Andahuaylas, which left at least 20 people injured including four police officers, according to Peru\u2019s Ombudsman\u2019s Office. Peru\u2019s Ministry of Health said Sunday evening that two people have died and three hospitalized in the Apur\u00edmac Region, where Andahuaylas Province is located, as a result of the protests. Castillo on Monday insisted that he is still Peru\u2019s President, according to a series of tweets posted on his Twitter account. He was impeached for attempting to dissolve the nation\u2019s Congress and for calling for new elections. \u201cI am unconditionally faithful to the popular and constitutional mandate that I hold as President, and I WILL NOT RESIGN OR ABANDON MY HIGH AND SACRED FUNCTIONS,\u201d a portion of the message reads. Castillo also claimed that he had been \u201ckidnapped,\u201d as well as \u201chumiliated\u201d and \u201cmistreated,\u201dand called for his own release, according to a handwritten letter he wrote which was also posted to his account on Monday.     Castillo\u2019s lawyer, Ronald Atencio, has verified the authenticity of the letter and the tweets to CNN.  The tweets were authorized by the former president to be written on his behalf.   Rising anger On Monday, Alfredo Rodriguez Ballon airport in Peru\u2019s largest southern city of Arequipa was temporarily closed due to protests, according to a statement by the Andean Airports of Peru, tweeted by the country\u2019s Ministry of Transport and Communications. \u201cOur Alfredo Rodriguez Ball\u00f3n airport in the city of Arequipa has been invaded by a group of protesters who have entered through the perimeter fence, destroying the security infrastructure and setting fire to security gate, which has put the safety of passengers, our team and air operations at risk,\u201d read the statement. Images of the scene showed smoke in the distance while protesters walked on the airport\u2019s runway.  The airport evacuated those inside the terminal, and later on Monday, officials told local media that the situation was \u201cunder control.\u201d \u201cThe situation at Arequipa is under control, police has control of the airport (inside). We ask citizens to exercise their right to protest but in a peaceful way and not to put at risk people\u2019s lives,\u201d Angel Manrique of the Ombudsman\u2019s Office in Arequipa said in an interview with local radio RPP on Monday. In footage from the southern city of Ica, a vehicle was overturned and protesters blocked streets. Police were seen clashing with demonstrators, who were throwing stones at the forces.   On Sunday, at least 50 people, including police officers and airport workers, were also being held as \u201chostages\u201d after attacks and \u201cacts of vandalism\u201d by protesters at the Huancabamba de Andahuaylas airport in the city of Andahuaylas, the Peruvian Corporation of Airports and Commercial Aviation said in a statement. The airport has been closed as a result, the organization said, adding that they have asked the national police for support and reinforcement and to help \u201csafeguard the lives of the people who are being held hostage.\u201d The organization did not provide information on the condition of the hostages. Peru\u2019s Corporation of Airports and Commercial Aviation accused protesters of setting fire to the airport\u2019s transmission room, fuel room and encircling the terminal with \u201cacts of violence,\u201d it said in a statement. It also said the landing strip and essential equipment had been \u201cseriously affected.\u201d The country has been on the brink since Castillo\u2019s ouster last week. Many Peruvians have been calling for a change in the political guard, according to September poll by the Institute of Peruvian Studies (IEP), which found 60% of those surveyed supported early elections to refresh both the presidency and Congress. Boluarte\u2019s ascendency to the presidency may not necessarily ease Peru\u2019s toxic and embittered political landscape. Fernando Tuesta Soldevilla, professor of political science at Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP), told CNN that Boluarte \u201cdoes not have a recognized political career. And without partisan support, political party or social organization behind her, she is weak from the beginning.\u201d \u201cEveryone knows when Dina Boluarte\u2019s government began, but no one can be sure how long it will last,\u201d he said.

Electrical lines and trees were also knocked down,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said. \u201cCaddo deputies, K-9 teams, fireman, and volunteers are searching through debris and the area for the missing people. Caddo deputies continue to check the welfare of citizens from house to house.\u201d  Authorities are \u201cin search and rescue operations of a subdivision that contains approximately 40 homes,\u201d Caddo Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office Homeland Security Deputy Director Robert Jump tells CNN. In a Facebook post Tuesday evening, the Caddo Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office asked anyone concerned with missing people to contact their dispatch.  A tornado watch is in effect for northeast Louisiana, southwest Arkansas and western Mississippi until 2 a.m. CST, according to the Storm Prediction Center. This watch covers more than 1.5 million people and includes Shreveport and Alexandria, Louisiana. \u201cA few tornadoes and a couple intense tornadoes [are] possible,\u201d the Storm Prediction Center said.  Additionally, damaging winds up to 70 mph are also possible. Damage on Tuesday includes: \u2022 Grapevine, Texas: At least one tornado was reported in this city just outside Dallas Tuesday morning, the National Weather Service said, and storms left at least five people there injured, Grapevine police said. Details about the injuries weren\u2019t immediately available. Businesses including a Grapevine mall, a Sam\u2019s Club and a Walmart were damaged, police said. A gas station was destroyed, and drivers on one road were forced to share a single lane because downed trees and other debris blocked parts of the thoroughfare, motorist Claudio Ropain David told CNN.  \u2022 Elsewhere outside Dallas: At least two people were injured, and homes and businesses were damaged, as severe weather hit east of Paradise and south of Decatur in Wise County on Tuesday morning, northwest of Fort Worth, county officials said. One person was hurt when wind overturned their vehicle, and the other \u2013 also in a vehicle \u2013 was hurt by flying debris, the Wise County emergency management office said. One was taken to a hospital, the office said without elaborating. High winds also damaged homes and trees near Callisburg north of Dallas, blew over tractor-trailers near the towns of Millsap and Weatherford; and damaged barns near the town of Jacksboro, the National Weather Service said. \u2022 Wayne, Oklahoma: A confirmed EF2 tornado in that town knocked out power and damaged homes, outbuildings and barns early Tuesday, officials said, adding no injuries were reported. Homes were flattened or had roofs torn off, and trees were snapped like twigs, video from CNN affiliate KOCO showed. The storm that rocked Wayne was on the ground for at least 3 miles with 120-125 mph winds, the National Weather Service in Norman, Oklahoma, said.  More severe storms capable of tornadoes, as well as hail and damaging winds are expected Tuesday and Wednesday in the Gulf Coast region as the complex snow-or-rain system sweeps through the central US from north to south.  Blizzard and ice warnings in the north-central US Across the central and northern Plains and Upper Midwest, heavy, blowing snow and/or freezing rain into Thursday could snarl travel and threaten power outages.  Blizzard warnings \u2013 forecasting at least three hours of sustained winds or frequent gusts at 35 mph or greater during considerable snowfall and poor visibility \u2013 extended Tuesday from parts of Montana and Wyoming into northeastern Colorado, western Nebraska and South Dakota. Blizzard conditions were being reported in the morning and early afternoon near the Colorado-Kansas state line. Visibility along Interstate 70 in that area was down to 100 feet, a Kansas Highway Patrol spokesman said on Twitter.  Snowfall through Wednesday morning generally could be 10 to 18 inches in the central and northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Some areas inside the blizzard warning zones \u2013 particularly western South Dakota, eastern Wyoming and northwestern Nebraska \u2013 could get as many as 24 inches of snow, with winds strong enough to knock down tree limbs and cause power outages, the Weather Prediction Center said. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem announced Tuesday that all state government executive branch offices statewide will be closed Tuesday due to the winter storm.  Most state offices in South Dakota will be closed again Wednesday and state workers who are normally in the offices affected will be working remotely, the governor\u2019s office said. State offices will be reopening Wednesday in 11 southeast counties that have less severe travel conditions.  \u201cOfficials continue to closely monitor the storm which features heavy snow, freezing rain, and high winds,\u201d the governor\u2019s office said. \u201cA decision on state government office availability for Thursday will be made Wednesday.\u201d Parts of Wyoming have reported snow accumulations between 1 and 2 feet, according to the National Weather Service. The state\u2019s Department of Transportation on Tuesday said wintry weather is impacting roadways throughout the entire state. \u201cNot a single green stretch of road in the state,\u201d the department said in a Facebook post. \u201cStrong winds, blowing snow, whiteout conditions and slick spots are impacting routes statewide (and in some neighboring states!)\u201d The Wyoming Highway Patrol also advised motorists to be aware of road conditions, as \u201cmany roads across Wyoming are currently closed due to crashes and winter conditions.\u201d  In Sidney, Nebraska, winds whipped Tuesday morning at 53 mph, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said, \u201cand then you add in the snow, visibility is a quarter mile.\u201d  Interstates in South Dakota could become impassable amid the blizzard conditions, resulting in roadway closures across the state, the South Dakota Department of Transportation warned Monday. Ice storm warnings were issued for parts of eastern South Dakota. Up to two-tenths of an inch of ice could accumulate in some of these areas, forecasters said. Wintry precipitation \u201cwill begin to spread eastward over the Upper Great Lakes late Tuesday and Wednesday and into the Northeast late Wednesday as the storm system continues eastward,\u201d the prediction center said.   Freezing rain and sleet, meanwhile, will be possible through Wednesday in the Upper Midwest. More tornadoes are a threat on the storm\u2019s southern end Meanwhile, the southern end of the storm threatens to bring more tornadoes. An alert for enhanced risk of severe weather \u2013 level 3 of 5 \u2013 was issued Tuesday for eastern Texas and the lower Mississippi River Valley, with the main threats including powerful tornadoes, damaging winds, and large hail. Baton Rouge, Shreveport, and Lafayette, Louisiana, are part of the threatened area, as is Jackson, Mississippi. \u201cMy main concern with the tornadoes is going to be after dark,\u201d Myers said Tuesday. \u201cWe have very short days this time of year, so 5 or 6 o\u2019clock, it\u2019s going to be dark out there. Spotters aren\u2019t as accurate when it is dark. Tornado warnings are a little bit slow; if you\u2019re sleeping, you may not get them. So, that\u2019s the real danger with this storm.\u201d A zone of slight risk \u2013 level 2 of 5 \u2013 encircled that area, stretching from eastern Texas and southern Oklahoma to southern Arkansas and much of the rest of Louisiana, including New Orleans, and central Mississippi. Tuesday also brings a slight risk of excessive rainfall in parts of Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, with 2 to 4 inches of rain and flash flooding possible, the Weather Prediction Center said. On Wednesday, the threat for severe weather is largely focused on the Gulf Coast, with tornadoes and damaging winds possible over parts of southern Louisiana, Mississippi, southwest Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle, the Storm Prediction Center said.  In Mississippi, the Meridian Public School District \u2013 which serves over 4,900 students \u2013 announced they will be closed Wednesday due to the threat of severe weather. Meridian is about 86 miles east of Jackson.  \u201cAll schools, offices, and departments in the Meridian Public School District will be closed on Wednesday, December 14, 2022, due to the threat of 70 mph winds and possible tornadoes throughout the day on Wednesday, December 14, 2022.  All extracurricular activities and practices are also canceled for December 14, 2022,\u201d the school district said in a message on Facebook. The Lawrence County and McComb School Districts also announced they were closing Wednesday due to the threat of severe weather. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency also noted the severe weather expected in the state and asked residents to prepare.  \u201cWith severe weather expected throughout Mississippi tonight and tomorrow, please review your severe weather preparedness checklist to make sure you are ready for the storms,\u201d the agency said in a message on Twitter.

Most of those outages \u2013 about 115,000 \u2013 were in Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota. Ferocious winds from blizzard conditions knocked down power lines in the Upper Midwest, and temperatures in some areas without power plunged to near or below freezing.  In the South, which was hit by multiple tornadoes, about 10,000 power customers were in the dark Thursday morning. About 9,000 outages were reported in Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia.  A mother and child were killed and found far from their home The same storm system now slamming eastern states left a trail of devastation in Gulf Coast states.  At least 50 tornado reports have been made since Tuesday in Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, Texas Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma. At least three deaths in Louisiana have been linked to the storm. Yoshiko A. Smith, 30, and her 8-year-old son, Nikolus Little, were killed Tuesday when a tornado struck Caddo Parish and destroyed their home, local officials said. Their bodies were found far from where their house once stood, officials said. Autopsies have been ordered for both, the county coronor said. In St. Charles Parish, a 56-year-old woman died after a tornado hit her home, the Louisiana Department of Health said Wednesday. In Texas, a tornado struck Wise County near Paradise and Decatur on Tuesday, officials said. Video showed homes splintered, with roofs ripped off in Decatur. And in Wayne, Oklahoma, a tornado damaged homes and barns Tuesday, officials said. No injuries were reported, but homes were flattened or had roofs torn off, according to footage from CNN affiliate KOCO. \u2018All we could hear was glass popping everywhere\u2019 In the Louisiana town of Farmerville, at least 20 people were injured when a tornado struck Union Parish on Tuesday night \u2013 demolishing parts of an apartment complex and a mobile home park, Farmerville police Detective Cade Nolan said. Patsy Andrews was home with her children in Farmerville when she heard \u201crushing wind like a train\u201d outside, she told CNN affiliate KNOE-TV. Her son told her not to open the door when she went to investigate. But it was too late. \u201cAll of a sudden that wind was so heavy, it broke my back door,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThe lights went off and all we could hear was glass popping everywhere.\u201d Andrews said she and her daughter hit the floor, crawling into a hallway as glass shattered around them and water leaked through the roof. They ended up hunkering down in their bathroom. \u201cWe just got in the tub and we hugged each other. We just kept praying and I just kept calling on Jesus,\u201d Andrews said. Her family survived the storm but was left with a damaged home.  A tornado reportedly touched down in New Iberia, damaging several homes, the New Iberia Police Department said.  Iberia Medical Center \u201csustained a significant amount of damage,\u201d police Capt. Leland Laseter said on Facebook. CNN has sought comment from the medical center.  In Jefferson Parish, Councilman Scott Walker said he saw at least a mile-long path of debris. \u201cPower lines down, homes severely damaged, rooftops ripped off,\u201d he said in a video shared online describing the scene. \u201cIt is an extensive damage scene and a long path of destruction here on the west bank.\u201d And in Arabi, Louisiana, Cindy DeLucca Hernandez thought she could beat the storm while driving home with her 16-year-old son after school. Then she found herself facing a tornado.  Hernandez shared video with CNN that showed a tornado blowing through Arabi, kicking up debris and taking out power lines.  \u201cWe started seeing debris and we got hit a couple of times by it,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I put the car in reverse.\u201d Hernandez and her son made it home safely.

She is the country\u2019s sixth president in less than five years.  Boluarte announced Tuesday the government will set up a crisis management committee as protests calling for political change continue across the country. The committee will be led by Pedro Angulo, President of the Council of Ministers of Peru, and will include other representatives including the heads of the defense, transport, interior and communication ministries among others, the presidency announced on Twitter Tuesday.  Castillo has denied allegations of conspiracy and rebellion, following his impeachment and arrest last week. The former president has been detained last week. His seven-day preventive detention order was due to end at 1:42 p.m. ET on Wednesday. In a handwritten letter posted on Twitter, Castillo called for supporters to gather at that time at the detention center in Lima where he is being held.  However, a hearing to determine whether Castillo\u2019s detention will be extended has been postponed to Thursday morning, said Judge Juan Carlos Checkley at a virtual court session on Wednesday. Checkley said that Castillo will remain detained until then.   Army deployed to the streets  Castillo\u2019s supporters have been protesting since his arrest and impeachment last week. As of Tuesday evening, national roads in at least 14 regions across the country have been blocked by protests, the National Police of Peru said in a statement.  The army has been deployed in Peru to protect public spaces across the country amid ongoing protests, according to a statement by Peruvian Defense Minister Luis Alberto Ot\u00e1rola on Tuesday evening.  \u201cThe immediate protection by the Armed Forces of the strategic points of national assets, airports, hydroelectric plants and all that infrastructure that, due to its strategic value, serves to guarantee the life and subsistence of all Peruvians, has been ordered,\u201d Ot\u00e1rola explained in a statement broadcast by Peru\u2019s state-run media, Peru TV.   The defense minister also declared a state of emergency for the national road network.  \u201cWe are going to assume control of the national road network throughout the country, to ensure the free transit of all Peruvians,\u201d Ot\u00e1rola said. He also said that a state of emergency has specifically been implemented in the southern cities of Arequipa and Ica, \u201cso that the Armed Forces and the National Police can take control of the internal order.\u201d      Here\u2019s what you need to know What has sparked Peru\u2019s recent unrest? Peru was plunged into more political turmoil when Castillo was impeached and arrested on December 7, after he announced plans to dissolve Congress and install an emergency government ahead of a looming impeachment vote by lawmakers.  Boluarte, his former vice president, has since become president, and on Monday proposed bringing general elections forward two years to April 2024 during a televised speech.  Castillo\u2019s removal from power accelerated long-simmering political tensions in the country. Since last week, demonstrations have erupted in cities across the country, sometimes marked by clashes with Peru\u2019s security forces. Some are protesting in support of Castillo, while others want a total reset of the country with fresh general elections and a dissolution of Congress.   Who is Pedro Castillo? Elected in July 2021 by a narrow margin in a runoff, the former leftist leader promised \u201cto govern with the people and for the people\u201d but his short-lived presidency has largely focused on his own political survival. A former rural school teacher, Castillo survived two impeachment attempts in his first year as president and faces six ongoing investigations by the office of the National Prosecutor.  His government was mired in chaos since inauguration, with dozens of ministers appointed, replaced, sacked or resigned in little over a year \u2013 piling further pressure on the embattled president ahead of his ousting last week.   Castillo has railed against the opposition for trying to remove him from the first day he was in office and accused Peru\u2019s Attorney General, Patricia Benavides, of orchestrating what he called a new form of \u201ccoup d\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d against him. In October, Benavides filed a constitutional complaint against him based on three of the six investigations her office had opened. The complaint allowed congress to carry out its own investigation against the former president. The national prosecutor\u2019s office has looked into a cascade of investigations on whether Castillo used his position to benefit himself, his family and closest allies by peddling influence to gain favor or preferential treatment, among other claims.  Castillo has repeatedly denied all allegations and reiterated his willingness to cooperate with any investigation. He argues the allegations are a result of a witch-hunt against him and his family from groups that failed to accept his election victory.  Are the protests violent?  At least seven people have died in the protests ongoing in Peru, according to a tweet from the health ministry on Wednesday.  Two minors are among those killed, Peru\u2019s ombudsman\u2019s press office said on Tuesday. And at least 47 individuals were hospitalized as a result of protests in the cities of Lima, Apur\u00edmac, Huancavelica and Arequipa, Peru\u2019s Health Ministry tweeted. Boluarte on Tuesday called for calm to be restored to the country, and said that she had instructed police not to use any lethal arms against protesters. \u201cEveryone has the right to protest but not to commit vandalism, burn hospitals, ambulances, police stations, assault airports, (these) are not normal protests, we have reached the extreme,\u201d Boluarte added.  What other disruption has the unrest caused? Trail and air travel across some regions of Peru has been affected by the demonstrations. Trains to and from Machu Picchu were suspended from Tuesday, rail operator PeruRail said in a statement.  \u201cWe regret the inconvenience that these announcements generate for our passengers; however, they are due to situations beyond the control of our company and seek to prioritize the safety of passengers and workers,\u201d the statement read. Flights have also been disrupted due to protests, with LATAM Airlines Peru announcing the temporary suspension of services to and from airports in the cities of Arequipa and Cuzco. Protesters attempted to storm the terminal at Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport in Cuzco on Monday, according to the Peruvian Corporation of Airports and Commercial Aviation (CORPAC). So far there have been no reports of injuries, arrests or damage to the airport, according to CORPAC.  What do the demonstrators want? Demonstrators have called for a general election, the dissolution of Congress, and the creation of a new constituent assembly. Fernando Tuesta Soldevilla, a professor of political science at Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP), told CNN the protests represented a violent show of anger against \u201ceverything that has accumulated in the last few years: increasing social and economic ruptures.\u201d He added that protesters were also demonstrating over social and environmental issues, on top of their \u201cfurious rejection of Congress.\u201d However Peruvian lawmakers hold the key to calling new elections and they are unlikely to do so as they would be voting themselves out of a job, according to Tuesta Soldevilla.  Will Boluarte\u2019s ascendency bring stability? Peru has been racked with political instability in recent years, with many Peruvians calling for political change, according to a September poll by the Institute of Peruvian Studies, which found 60% of those surveyed supported early elections to refresh both the presidency and Congress.  It is unclear if Boluarte\u2019s ascendancy to the presidency can gain widespread political buy-in. Boluarte \u201cdoes not have a recognized political career,\u201d said Tuesta Soldevilla. \u201cAnd without partisan support, political party or social organization behind her, she is weak from the beginning.\u201d \u201cEveryone knows when Dina Boluarte\u2019s government began, but no one can be sure how long it will last,\u201d he told CNN. Boluarte also doesn\u2019t belong to a political party after she was expelled from Peru Libre due to internal disagreements. She would need to build bridges and achieve some consensus with the opposition in Congress to stay in office.

Nyirenda\u2019s body arrived at Kenneth Kaunda International Airport in the capital Lusaka and was accompanied by Zambia\u2019s Ambassador to Russia, Shadreck Luwita, its foreign ministry said. The body was received by Nyirenda\u2019s family and foreign ministry officials, the ministry stated in a series of tweets Sunday.  In agency pictures from the airport, a coffin can be seen in a white hearse with Cyrillic writing on the outside indicating the provenance of the casket. A group of choral singers and grieving family members were at the airport to receive Nyirenda\u2019s body.  He died in battle in Ukraine in September fighting for the Russian side.  His remains will be \u201ctransported directly to the University Hospital Mortuary\u201d and then a series of post-mortem checks will be performed before the body is released to the family and burial will take place, Nyirenda\u2019s family said Sunday. Scholarship student to prisoner Nyirenda, 23, was sponsored by the Zambian government to study nuclear engineering at the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute, according to the southern African country\u2019s foreign ministry. The ministry said the student was convicted in 2020 of unspecified crimes in Russia and sent to prison for nine years and six months, in a statement last month announcing his death. Yevgeny Prigozhin, known by the moniker \u2018Putin\u2019s Chef,\u2019 thanks to lucrative catering contracts he secured from the Kremlin, has admitted to being the head of Wagner. In the summer Prigozhin himself was leading recruitment drives in Russian penal colonies.  He appeared in various social media videos encourage prisoners to join the ranks of Wagner. In exchange for a tour of duty, prisoners are granted a healthy salary and amnesty upon completion \u2013 and survival \u2013 of six-month tour. Or they would receive a lump sum payment to their families on event of their deaths.  Last month, Prigozhin admitted to recruiting Nyirenda from a Russian jail, saying he chose to fight to \u201crepay (Africa\u2019s) debts\u201d to Russia and \u201cdied a hero.\u201d Speaking to parliament on Friday, Zambia\u2019s Foreign Minister Stanley Kakubo said Nyirenda was pardoned by the Russian government in August \u201cto join a military operation in exchange for amnesty.\u201d The suggestion from Minister Kakubo in his statement on Friday is that, the Russian government is aware and approves of Prigozhin\u2019s recruitment of Russian prisoners in Ukraine, something the government has never commented on. Last week, Russian media outlet RIA FAN, part of a media holdings company run by Prigozhin, published an article and video showing a \u201cfarewell ceremony\u201d for Nyirenda at a chapel in Krasnodar, southern Russia.   The video shows eight men in military fatigues, all clutching a candle surrounding a coffin draped in a Wagner black and red catafalque with a photo of Nyirenda and two medals on top. The article accompanying the video says that Nyirenda \u201cdied near Bakhmut\u201d and that he was \u201can attacker in the ranks of PMC Wagner.\u201d Bakhmut has been the scene of some of the fiercest fighting in eastern Ukraine, and a front where Wagner soldiers have been fighting. The chapel, which is briefly seen from the outside is known as the \u2018Wagner Chapel\u2019 and is a very rare look inside a secretive location connected to Wagner. "},

The move was widely expected, after the top leadership ruling African National Congress (ANC) called on their parliamentary caucus to block the investigation.  One by one, MPs were asked to articulate their vote in person after requests to hold the vote in secret will ruled out by the Speaker of Parliament. There were a few \u2018yes\u2019 votes from ANC members, and a couple of no-shows, but their caucus largely held together. Opposition parties were mostly unified on calling for an impeachment enquiry. The vote required a simple majority.\u00a0 The vote came after an independent panel independent panel found there is initial evidence that he could have violated his oath of office.  The findings relate to an ongoing scandal linked to the theft of more than $500,000 in cash from his private game farm in 2020. The cash was stuffed inside a leather sofa according to the panel investigation. The panel, led by a former chief justice, found that the crime was not reported to the police and that there was a \u2018deliberate decision to keep the investigation secret.\u2019 After initial speculation that he would resign, Ramaphosa\u2019s lawyers have sought to challenge the panel\u2019s findings in court. The president has repeatedly denied the allegations saying the money was from the sale of wildlife at his Phala Phala farm. Later this week, the president will contest an ANC elective conference, where he is widely expected to win. The vote was preceded by a spirited debate where opposition party leaders lambasted both the president for not providing a fuller explanation for the cash and the ANC caucus for backing him.  \u201cYou are so desperate to avoid any type of investigation into the crimes that have occurred in and in relation to the Phala Phala farm that you have decided to spit in the face of the freedoms and institutions so many people fought and died for,\u201d said Julius Malema, the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters. \u201cAs long as you have the numbers in parliament, you can make any scandal go away and if that is how you intend to vote today, in one unified shield against accountability and oversight, just like you did in the Zuma days then shame on you,\u201d said John Steenhuisen, the leader of the official opposition Democratic Alliance, referring to Ramaphosa\u2019s predecessor Jacob Zuma who was never censured by parliament, but was eventually forced to resign after a corruption scandal. ANC members said that the report did not provide enough evidence to move towards an impeachment proceeding. The president still could face multiple investigations outside of parliament."},

The rainfall began on Monday and continued through Tuesday, it said. Severe damage could be seen in video obtained by news agency Reuters, with roofs and roads collapsed and people walking knee-deep in water.  Congolese Prime Minister Jean-Michel Sama Lukonde chaired a crisis meeting Tuesday evening, with several local and police officials, the statement released by his office on Wednesday said.  Three days of national mourning has been declared \u201cfollowing the enormous loss of human life.\u201d  The government will also cover funeral costs for those deceased, the statement added.  The toll may still rise. Health minister Jean-Jacques Mbungani Mbanda told Reuters the ministry had counted 141 dead but that the number needed to be cross-checked with other departments.  Images posted on Twitter by Congo\u2019s government spokesman Patrick Muyaya showed a major road that appeared to have subsided into a deep chasm, with crowds staring at the damage. \u201cOn the National Road 1, there is a big hole. Only pedestrians can pass. We do not understand how the water cut the road,\u201d said local resident Gabriel Mbikolo.  Once a fishing village on the banks of the Congo river, Kinshasa has grown into one of Africa\u2019s largest megacities with a population of around 15 million. Poorly regulated rapid urbanization has made the city increasingly vulnerable to flash floods after intense rains, which have become more frequent due to climate change. At least 39 people died in Kinshasa in 2019 when torrential rain flooded low-lying districts and some buildings and roads collapsed. In addition to damaged infrastructure, each day of flooding costs households a combined $1.2 million due to the large-scale transport disruption, according to a 2020 World Bank paper.

Mae Beale, an 82-year-old retiree, just earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Management from University of Maryland Global Campus (UMGC). Beale decided to return to school in her late 70s, according to a news release from the school. She received her diploma May 18, the day after her 82nd birthday, reported CNN affiliate WJLA. In her younger years, Beale worked as a licensed practical nurse in Washington, DC, the release noted. While working at the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, she helped plan several large events, which inspired a career pivot.   In 1994, at the age of 54, Beale started her own event-planning business and started working toward her associate degree in Business Management at Howard Community College, according to the release. After completing the associate degree program, she decided to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree, one class at a time. \u201cI wanted to make certain I had the time to devote to whichever class I was taking,\u201d she said in the release. \u201cI was like the tortoise.

Beale received her diploma alongside 3,300 graduates from the classes of 2020, 2021, and 2022, Bob Ludwig, assistant vice president of media relations at the university, told CNN. She completed her coursework in the class of 2020, but the school has not held an in-person graduation ceremony since 2019 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Beale, who participates in several local boards in Maryland as a community advocate, told the university the degree has given her a greater sense of self-confidence: \u201cI knew that if I had the degree, it would solidify things and make me feel more comfortable.\u201d And she encouraged others to pursue higher education with an open mind. \u201cExpose yourself to as many possibilities as you can because you never know what life will present.\u201d  "},

This CNN Hero delivers \u2018Peace of Mind\u2019\n    ", "description": "When Carie Broecker discovered that many aging senior citizens struggle to care for their dogs, she started Peace of Mind Dog Rescue to help them. Since 2009, the nonprofit has provided volunteer services to 2,000 seniors while also rescuing senior dogs from shelters.", "date": "2022-07-28", "author": "Meg Dunn", "text": "Having a dog has been shown to improve the quality of life for senior citizens, increasing their activity and socialization. But what happens as the senior ages and it becomes more challenging to care for their pet? Carie Broecker learned about this issue more than a decade ago while helping to care for an elderly woman\u2019s dog. Broecker and the woman, Alice, had met five years earlier, when Alice adopted the dog Broecker was fostering. After Alice developed emphysema, she reached out to Broecker for help. Broecker took care of the dog, Savannah, while Alice was at medical appointments. When Alice was later moved to hospice, Broecker would bring the dog to visit. During Alice\u2019s final days, her biggest worry was what would happen to her dog after she passed. \u201cI said I promise I will make sure that Savannah finds a good home,\u201d Broecker said. \u201cShe was so relieved that I could make that promise to her.\u201d After leaving that visit with Alice, Broecker came up with an idea that would become her life\u2019s work. \u201cI remember it clear as day,\u201d Broecker said. \u201cThe whole concept of Peace of Mind Dog Rescue came to me: the name, and that we would take in dogs from senior citizens who were dying.\u201d Broecker co-founded the nonprofit with Monica Rua, who also worked in animal rescue and added the idea of rescuing senior dogs from shelters. In 2009, Peace of Mind Dog Rescue was born. The organization takes dogs from senior citizens who are no longer able to care for them, have gone into a nursing home or have passed away. Many times, it\u2019s family members who contact the organization to surrender their aging family member\u2019s dog.  \u201cOften times, the dog can be your last connection to that person,\u201d Broecker said. \u201cYou\u2019re giving away a part of that person who was so special to you. So, it can be really hard.\u201d Peace of Mind Dog Rescue finds these dogs new homes and checks in on the dog every year for the rest of their life.  \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it over and over again that dogs can adjust after losing their person and become part of a new family,\u201d Broecker said. \u201cYou\u2019d love for them to be together forever, but when that\u2019s not possible, we\u2019re really glad we\u2019re here to be a safety net.\u201d Typically, a senior doesn\u2019t need to surrender their dog, they just need some assistance. As part of the organization\u2019s dog walking program, a volunteer will go to the senior\u2019s house to walk their dog for 30 minutes or an hour.   \u201cWe can preserve that human-animal bond and make this person\u2019s life better and brighter through our services \u2026 it\u2019s about honoring the elderly,\u201d Broecker said.  The nonprofit also helps senior dogs find forever homes. It can be challenging for overcrowded shelters to give senior dogs the attention they need, so Peace of Mind Dog Rescue is in contact with local animal shelters to see what senior dogs they can pull and help adopt out. After a medical workup, the dogs are placed in foster homes. The organization has more than 160 foster homes available allowing the dogs a comfortable place to stay and the adopter to learn how the dog behaves in a home environment. Then the dog is put up for adoption. Broecker says they\u2019re up front with adopters about any medical issues, since many senior dogs have some degree of medical needs. \u201cIt blows us away over and over again how somebody will fall in love with a silly-looking blind chihuahua with a tongue hanging out and all kinds of medical issues,\u201d Broecker said.  To date, the organization has helped 2,000 senior citizens and found homes for nearly 3,000 dogs. For Broecker, this work is about allowing seniors to pass through the final phase of their lives with dignity.   \u201cIn our society, sometimes the elderly, whether that is senior people or senior dogs, get ignored,\u201d Broecker said. \u201cWe really want to cherish all of life.\u201d  CNN\u2019s Meg Dunn spoke with Broecker about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation. CNN: Your organization has recently opened a veterinary clinic. How has that helped your work?  Carie Broecker: About 10 years into operating Peace of Mind Dog Rescue, we realized we needed our own veterinary clinic. We used to contract with about 15 different veterinarians in the area. And they were all wonderful, they gave us a discount, but it was a lot of administrative management of the medical records, and it was cost prohibitive. But now, with our own vet clinic, we can rescue even more and save a lot of time.  We have our own veterinary staff, so all of the dogs get a complete exam, heartworm test, senior blood panel, urinalysis. A lot of times they need x-rays or ultrasounds for various things, biopsies of any kind of masses. CNN: You\u2019ve also expanded your program to help more than just seniors.  Broecker: We have our Helping Paw financial assistance program. So low-income pet guardians \u2013 and a lot of senior citizens are in that low-income category \u2013 if they have veterinary care that\u2019s needed and they can\u2019t afford it, we have $500 grants each year for people to apply. And sometimes it\u2019s just an ear infection, sometimes we\u2019re paying because the dog has a broken leg and we\u2019re contributing $500 to that. But that\u2019s how we help to keep people and their animals together. CNN: Why do you think people should adopt a senior dog?  Broecker: There are a lot of benefits to adopting a senior dog. They\u2019re typically calmer and have some sort of training. They usually kind of get how life works, and it\u2019s very rewarding for the person. I know it sounds kind of clich\u00e9, but I really do feel like they are grateful, and they know what they\u2019ve been through, and there\u2019s a relief once they settle.  When they finally just curl up and lay down and just give a sigh, you just feel like, \u201cOkay, they just realized they\u2019re home.\u201d Want to get involved?

Stroud and Georgia Bulldogs quarterback Stetson Bennett to win the treasured college football award. In his acceptance speech, Williams hailed the three other finalists and credited his parents, teammates and coaches for him being able to win the award.  \u201cIf you are willing to put in the work and surround yourself with positive people, you can achieve anything,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI used to write down my goals in a journal and what used to just be words on a piece of paper, has me standing here today. So everyone, dreams really do come true. Thank you. Fight on!\u201d  Williams is the seventh Trojan to win the award and the first since quarterback Matt Leinart in 2004.  Former Trojan running back Reggie Bush won the award in 2005 but was stripped of it after an NCAA investigation found Bush received impermissible benefits, including several thousand dollars and a vehicle while in school.  Last year, after the NCAA approved a new policy for student athletes to make money on their names, images and likeness, they said Bush will not get the trophy back. Williams\u2019 Heisman award caps off a season in which USC ended up just short of the College Football Playoff. Williams suffered a hamstring injury in the Trojans\u2019 loss to the University of Utah in the Pac-12 championship game last week.

Boluarte became Peru\u2019s first female president last week after lawmakers removed her predecessor Pedro Castillo. She initially ruled out early elections last week, but protests calling for political change have ensued around the country, leaving at least two people dead and prompting the United Nations Human Rights Office to air its concern about escalated tensions. \u201cWith violence increasing as protests continue in Peru, we are deeply concerned that the situation may escalate further,\u201d its spokesperson Marta Hurtado said. \u201cGiven the number of protests, including strikes, planned for this week, we call on all involved to exercise restraint.\u201d  Since last week, protests erupted in cities across the country in support of Castillo, who is currently under a seven-day preliminary arrest ordered by Peru\u2019s Supreme Court and has not accepted his removal, calling Boluarte an \u201cusurper.\u201d  Demonstrators have called for another general election, the dissolution of Congress, and the creation of a new constituent assembly, according to the radio and television broadcaster Radio Programas del Per\u00fa. On Saturday, protesters also demonstrated in the city of Andahuaylas, which left at least 20 people injured including four police officers, according to Peru\u2019s Ombudsman\u2019s Office. Peru\u2019s Ministry of Health said Sunday evening that two people have died and three hospitalized in the Apur\u00edmac Region, where Andahuaylas Province is located, as a result of the protests. Castillo on Monday insisted that he is still Peru\u2019s President, according to a series of tweets posted on his Twitter account. He was impeached for attempting to dissolve the nation\u2019s Congress and for calling for new elections. \u201cI am unconditionally faithful to the popular and constitutional mandate that I hold as President, and I WILL NOT RESIGN OR ABANDON MY HIGH AND SACRED FUNCTIONS,\u201d a portion of the message reads. Castillo also claimed that he had been \u201ckidnapped,\u201d as well as \u201chumiliated\u201d and \u201cmistreated,\u201dand called for his own release, according to a handwritten letter he wrote which was also posted to his account on Monday.     Castillo\u2019s lawyer, Ronald Atencio, has verified the authenticity of the letter and the tweets to CNN.  The tweets were authorized by the former president to be written on his behalf.   Rising anger On Monday, Alfredo Rodriguez Ballon airport in Peru\u2019s largest southern city of Arequipa was temporarily closed due to protests, according to a statement by the Andean Airports of Peru, tweeted by the country\u2019s Ministry of Transport and Communications. \u201cOur Alfredo Rodriguez Ball\u00f3n airport in the city of Arequipa has been invaded by a group of protesters who have entered through the perimeter fence, destroying the security infrastructure and setting fire to security gate, which has put the safety of passengers, our team and air operations at risk,\u201d read the statement. Images of the scene showed smoke in the distance while protesters walked on the airport\u2019s runway.  The airport evacuated those inside the terminal, and later on Monday, officials told local media that the situation was \u201cunder control.\u201d \u201cThe situation at Arequipa is under control, police has control of the airport (inside). We ask citizens to exercise their right to protest but in a peaceful way and not to put at risk people\u2019s lives,\u201d Angel Manrique of the Ombudsman\u2019s Office in Arequipa said in an interview with local radio RPP on Monday. In footage from the southern city of Ica, a vehicle was overturned and protesters blocked streets. Police were seen clashing with demonstrators, who were throwing stones at the forces.   On Sunday, at least 50 people, including police officers and airport workers, were also being held as \u201chostages\u201d after attacks and \u201cacts of vandalism\u201d by protesters at the Huancabamba de Andahuaylas airport in the city of Andahuaylas, the Peruvian Corporation of Airports and Commercial Aviation said in a statement. The airport has been closed as a result, the organization said, adding that they have asked the national police for support and reinforcement and to help \u201csafeguard the lives of the people who are being held hostage.\u201d The organization did not provide information on the condition of the hostages. Peru\u2019s Corporation of Airports and Commercial Aviation accused protesters of setting fire to the airport\u2019s transmission room, fuel room and encircling the terminal with \u201cacts of violence,\u201d it said in a statement. It also said the landing strip and essential equipment had been \u201cseriously affected.\u201d The country has been on the brink since Castillo\u2019s ouster last week. Many Peruvians have been calling for a change in the political guard, according to September poll by the Institute of Peruvian Studies (IEP), which found 60% of those surveyed supported early elections to refresh both the presidency and Congress. Boluarte\u2019s ascendency to the presidency may not necessarily ease Peru\u2019s toxic and embittered political landscape. Fernando Tuesta Soldevilla, professor of political science at Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP), told CNN that Boluarte \u201cdoes not have a recognized political career. And without partisan support, political party or social organization behind her, she is weak from the beginning.\u201d \u201cEveryone knows when Dina Boluarte\u2019s government began, but no one can be sure how long it will last,\u201d he said.

It said a number of people had been detained but did not say say how many. Meanwhile, the National Police reported that two police officers who were taken captive by the protesters had now been released and were being evaluated by medical personnel. The reason for Saturday\u2019s protest is not yet clear, but Andahuaylas is one of several towns in the country where residents took to the streets this Friday in support of former President Pedro Castillo who was ousted earlier this week, according to information provided to the media by the Ministry of Interior.   Castillo was removed from power on Wednesday after he attempted to dissolve Peru\u2019s Congress and call for new elections. He was arrested for the alleged crime of rebellion and impeached by lawmakers in a single day.  Peruvian lawmakers described the move as a coup, and a majority of the 130-person Congress voted to impeach Castillo on the same day, which ended with the swearing in of Dina Boluarte to the top position. Peru\u2019s new President ruled out early elections on Thursday on her first day in office following the dramatic ousting and arrest of her predecessor. Castillo is also currently under a seven-day preliminary arrest ordered by the Supreme Court on Thursday after considering him as a flight risk. Castillo has faced a cascade of investigations on whether he used his position to benefit himself, his family and closest allies by peddling influence to gain favor or preferential treatment, among other claims. He has repeatedly denied all allegations and reiterated his willingness to cooperate with any investigation. He argues the allegations are a result of a witch-hunt against him and his family from groups that failed to accept his election victory. The Ombudsman Office reiterated its \u201ccall to the population not to resort to violent means during their protests\u201d and asked the National Police that \u201cany action to restore public order must be carried out within the framework of the law of use of force.\u201d CNN\u2019s Claudia Rebaza, Tara John, Stefano Pozzebon and Hande Atay Alam contributed to this report."},

The ESL had accused FIFA and UEFA of anti-competitive behavior incompatible with EU competition laws and brought proceedings before the Commercial Court in which it requested the Court of Justice to rule on the matter.  \u201cFIFA welcomes the Opinion issued today by Advocate General Rantos of the European Court of Justice in which he confirms the standing and legitimacy of FIFA and UEFA to approve any new football competitions,\u201d FIFA said in a statement.  \u201cBy the same token, the Advocate General considers that sanctions may be imposed in respect of competitions which do not satisfy the approved authorization criteria. FIFA also welcomes the Advocate General\u2019s recognition of FIFA\u2019s exclusive rights to market international competitions organized by FIFA. \u201cFinally, FIFA welcomes the recognition by the Advocate General of the special nature of sport, including the pyramid structure, which preserves the nature of sporting merit and open competitions accessible to all, as well as the principles of promotion and relegation, competitive balance, and financial solidarity.\u201d In a statement released on Thursday UEFA said it welcomed the EU Opinion describing it as \u201can encouraging step towards preserving the existing dynamic and democratic governance structure of the European football pyramid.\u201d \u201cFootball in Europe remains united and steadfastly opposed to the European Super League, or any such breakaway proposals, which would threaten the entire European sports ecosystem,\u201d UEFA added.  Spain\u2019s La Liga, the only league involved in the procedure, supported the EU Opinion saying \u201cthat FIFA and UEFA rules under which any new competition is subject to prior approval are compatible with EU competition law.\u201d  \u201cLa Liga, along with other European leagues, will continue to fight for the right of European institutions to legislate and provide legal protection for the current European football model,\u201d said La Liga president Javier Tebas.  The European Club Association (ECA) which represents nearly 250 of Europe\u2019s top football clubs, also welcomed the Opinion saying, it \u201cproposes a clear rejection of the efforts of a few to undermine the foundations and historical heritage of European football for the many.\u201d  \u201cThe Opinion published today by Advocate General Rantos reinforces ECA\u2019s long-standing opposition to the European Super League and any breakaway project,\u201d the ECA added.  A22 Sports Management \u2013 a company that was formed to sponsor and assist in the creation of the ESL \u2013 believes that the ruling was a step in the right direction as it said UEFA has a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to not unduly deny new competitions. \u201cWe are pleased with the recognition of the right of third parties to organise pan-European club competitions,\u201d said A22 CEO Bernd Reichart. \u201cWe believe the 15 judges of the Grand Chamber who are entrusted with the responsibility to examine this case, will go substantially further and provide the opportunity for clubs to manage their own destiny in Europe.\u201d The EU Court of Justice is set to make a final judgement in 2023.  CNN contacted Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus, three teams who are still open to a Super League, for comment and did not immediately hear back."},

The storm already brought avalanche warnings to parts of the West, shutting down major highways as conditions became icy. Almost 15 million people in over a dozen states are under some level of winter weather alert as the powerful storm moves across the county, bringing with it a multiday severe storm threat. Sign up to receive weekly email updates from CNN Meteorologists. Blinding blizzard conditions The storm will strengthen as it travels eastward, bringing snow to the Rockies tonight, where a foot of snow is expected before the system strengthens even more.  The Upper Midwest, and northern and central Plains will get hit the hardest Monday night into Tuesday as widespread heavy snow falls. \u201cSnow accumulations through Tuesday morning will generally range between 6 to 12 inches, centered on the Northern High Plains,\u201d the US weather prediction center said. \u201cThe highest snow totals are currently forecast for western South Dakota and northwestern Nebraska, where upwards of 18 to 24 inches is possible.\u201d   Meanwhile, a widespread area from eastern Wyoming and Colorado to western South Dakota and Nebraska will also have winds gusts as high as 60 mph. Heavy snowfall and strong winds will set the stage for a blizzard, leading to whiteout conditions and impossible travel. Blizzard conditions are when there are sustained winds of 35 mph or higher and visibility below a quarter mile for at least three consecutive hours. Winter storm alerts stretch from the Canadian border to the Mexican border and blizzard warnings extend from just west of Denver into the Dakotas. \u201cAll preparations for this storm should be well underway and completed sooner rather than later,\u201d the National Weather Service office in Rapid City said.   Some locales inside the blizzard warning areas could pick up as much as 20 inches of snow. The winds could be strong enough to knock down tree limbs and cause power outages, and the harsh conditions could be deadly for anyone outdoors.  \u201cThe cold wind chills, as low as 20 below zero, could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes,\u201d the weather service office in Cheyenne, Wyoming, said.  Farther east, ice warnings blanket eastern North Dakota, where nearly half an inch of ice could accumulate. If it materializes, power outages are certain and travel will be impossible. Icing is also possible across southwestern Minnesota and western Iowa, where as much as a tenth of an inch of ice could develop. Even Anchorage schools are closed While the Anchorage school district builds two snow days into the calendar, the system has been closed for four. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual. Unsafe road conditions have prevented us from returning to school,\u201d Anchorage School District spokesperson MJ Thim said. The current snow depth in Anchorage, Alaska, is 31 inches, making it the greatest since March 27, 2012, according to a tweet from Alaska climate scientist Brian Brettschneider.  Between 12 and 24 inches of snow fell in the region Sunday into Monday morning, according to the National Weather Service. It was second significant snow storm in less than a week.   Thim said officials are looking at their options, including remote learning, depending on future snowfall totals. Multiday severe storm threat While the storm brings whiteout conditions to the North, the southern section of the storm will have the potential to bring late-season tornadoes along with strong thunderstorms.  On Monday evening, storms will fire up across western Kansas, as well as across portions of Texas and Oklahoma. The Storm Prediction Center is expecting storms to rapidly develop tonight, after dark. A Level 2 of 5 risk of severe weather has been issued for the area, including Oklahoma City and Norman in Oklahoma as well as Colby and Garden City in Kansas, and Wichita Falls in Texas. \u201cOccasional damaging winds, isolated large hail, and a couple of tornadoes will be possible tonight,\u201d the Storm Prediction Center said.  Track the storms as they develop here. As the storm system strengthens and pushes eastward on Tuesday, the possibility of damaging winds, hail, flash flooding and even strong tornadoes will be a concern for portions of the Deep South, especially central Louisiana and eastern Texas.  \u201cAll modes of severe will be possible with damaging winds, hail and some more late fall tornadoes,\u201d the weather service office in Shreveport said.  Shreveport, Monroe and Alexandria in Louisiana are in a Level 3 of 5 risk for severe weather. Dallas, Fort Worth, and New Orleans are under a Level 2 risk.  \u201cA couple of strong tornadoes will be possible, especially with any isolated storms which can develop just ahead of the main convective band,\u201d the Storm Prediction Center said.  By Wednesday, the storms are not expected to be quite as intense, but could still be strong along the Gulf Coast. New Orleans, Mobile and Tallahassee are all under a Level 2 of 5 risk of severe weather, as the potential for tornadoes will still exist.  Very heavy rain will also be of concern as several inches of rain could fall in a short amount of time within some of the heaviest downpours.  There is a Level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall focused across the Lower Mississippi River Valley as rainfall amounts could top 4 inches, leading to isolated pockets of flash flooding.  The area has been starving for rain as the Mississippi River has seen some of the lowest water levels on record this fall. The rain this week could actually help the gauge near Memphis get above low water stage for the first time since mid-August. The slight bump in water level is only expected to be temporary, but it\u2019s a positive sign moving forward. \u2018It looks a lot like Christmas out here\u2019 The storm already made for icy and dangerous conditions on key roadways, with authorities on Saturday closing down a long stretch of Interstate 80, from Colfax in Northern California to Stateline, Nevada, due to \u201cblowing snow & near-zero visibility,\u201d Caltrans, the state transportation agency, said on Twitter. In the Sierra Nevada, snowpack totals are already above average, according to the National Weather Service in Reno. \u201cThe snowpack is about 225% of normal, so it\u2019s more than twice what we\u2019d be expecting this time in December,\u201d said Mark Deutschendorf, forecaster at the National Weather Service office in Reno. The Tahoe Basin and the Eastern Sierra are seeing snowfall totals which are typically recorded in January. The storm blanketed some mountain areas of drought-parched California with thick snow, including Soda Springs in the northern part of the state, which received 60 inches of snow in just 48 hours. \u201cIt looks a lot like Christmas out here,\u201d Deutschendorf said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come with a lot of wind, and it stuck to everything. It\u2019s like a picture postcard.\u201d  While he noted the snow totals so far are impressive, Deutschendorf said he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about this precipitation putting a big dent in the state\u2019s drought. \u201cWe had a similar run of storms last year. We had a nice head start, and then January through March were incredibly dry,\u201d Deutschendorf explained. In California over the weekend, 48 inches of snow fell in Twin Bridges in a 48-hour period, 46 inches fell in Tahoe-Donner, 45 inches in Donner Peak and 44 inches at Palsades Tahoe Ski Base. \u201cWe\u2019re Buried,\u201d the Palisades Tahoe Ski Resort wrote on its website Sunday, sharing photos of thick snow covering the ski resort in Olympic Valley, California. \u201cThis is definitely a storm to remember. We\u2019ve now received 7.5 feet of snow since December 1st. Plus, in just 24 hours from Saturday morning to Sunday morning, we received more than 35 inches of snow \u2014 the 6th largest snowfall total in 24 hours that we have on record,\u201d resort operators wrote.

Castillo, who was removed from power on Wednesday after he attempted to dissolve Peru\u2019s Congress and call for new elections, was arrested while allegedly traveling to the Mexican Embassy, according to Peruvian prosecutors. Mexico\u2019s Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard later said that Castillo requested for asylum, and Mexican President Lopez Obrador criticized Peruvian elites, calling for the protection of the ousted president\u2019s human rights.  Lopez Obrado also said he had directed Ambassador Pablo Monroy to \u201copen the embassy\u2019s door\u201d to Castillo. Monroy reportedly met with Castillo on Thursday.

Click here to nominate them as a CNN Hero. Growing up in poverty in rural Kenya, Nelly Cheboi watched her single mother, who had only completed fifth grade, work tirelessly so Cheboi and her three sisters could attend school.  From an early age, Cheboi realized that her family, along with others like hers in their village, was stuck in a cycle that left them little hope. \u201cShe was working really hard, and I was still going to bed hungry. I was still sent home for tuition. I was still living in a house that was flooding,\u201d said Cheboi, now 29. \u201cLooking at the poverty in the household, looking at the community and suffering, it just became so clear that I needed to do something.\u201d Cheboi attended college on scholarship in the United States, worked odd jobs to support her family, and discovered her passion for computer science. She credits computer literacy for her ability to find job opportunities and make money doing what she loves. She knew she wanted to share it with her community back home. Today, she\u2019s giving 4,000 kids the chance for a brighter future through her nonprofit, TechLit Africa. The organization, whose name is short for Technologically Literate Africa, uses recycled computers to create technology labs in schools in rural Kenya.  \u201cI know the pain of poverty, and that\u2019s why I feel so passionate about it,\u201d said Cheboi, a software engineer who splits her time between the US and Kenya. \u201cI never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.\u201d In 2012, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois and began her studies with almost no computer experience. She handwrote papers and struggled to transcribe them on a laptop. She said she never felt comfortable using a computer until her junior year when she took a Java course required for her mathematics major. \u201cWhen I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,\u201d she said.  Cheboi switched to a double major and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. Yet she says skills like touch-typing that came seamlessly to some were still a steep learning curve for her. At one point after college, she had to practice for six months before she could pass a coding interview. It\u2019s a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum. \u201cI feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,\u201d she said. Cheboi made inroads with businesses in her profession, and in 2018 she began accepting recycled computers from them. She started small, carrying the machines to Kenya in check-on bags and handling customs fees and taxes herself. \u201cAt one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,\u201d she said. TechLit Africa now works with freight and shipping companies to transport the donated computers so it\u2019s more cost efficient. The donated hardware is wiped, refurbished and distributed to partner schools in rural Kenya, where students aged 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals and gain skills that will help improve their education and prepare them for future jobs. \u201cWe have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,\u201d Cheboi said. \u201cThey can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production with our artists.\u201d Cheboi\u2019s organization maintains online and onsite ownership of the computers, providing tech support, software updates and troubleshooting. TechLit Africa installs new customer operating systems geared towards children, and schools are asked to pay a small fee for the services, which includes TechLit educators onsite from 8am-4pm. The organization currently serves 10 schools, and by early next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more. \u201cMy hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they\u2019re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they know how to do marketing,\u201d Cheboi said. \u201cThe world is your oyster when you are educated.

It is hardly the scene where one would expect to find the climate\u2019s salvation. And yet as Luis Guedes Pinto climbed his sky-high perch above a reclaimed swath of Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest, he explained you don\u2019t have to go to the Arctic or even the Amazon to learn how to nurse Earth\u2019s forests back to health. \u201cThis project doesn\u2019t change a big landscape, but it shows it\u2019s possible to bring back life, to bring back water, to bring back biodiversity, to the center of the state of Sao Paulo,\u201d said Pinto, the CEO at SOS Mata Atl\u00e2ntica, as he pointed down to two square miles of forest restoration.   Pinto\u2019s organization is a non-profit devoted to rehabilitating the swath of forest on Brazil\u2019s Atlantic coast. The forest itself is home to more than 145 million Brazilians, and \u2014 just as the Amazon rainforest has been ravaged by deforestation in the past several years \u2014 around three-quarters of it has already been wiped out by urban and infrastructure development and aggressive agribusiness practices.  \u201cWe need to plant and replant, but we cannot lose another acre,\u201d Pinto said as he guided CNN through a nursery with more than 50 species of carefully cultivated trees and plants in what was once degraded, drought-prone pasture. \u201cA forest we replant is not going to be the same as a forest we cut down. Some of the forests we\u2019re losing have trees in them that are hundreds of years old.\u201d These are the seedlings of a forest\u2019s revival. In just 15 years, it has become a thriving eco-lab with a healthy water table, trees, plants and animals. It is a completely different landscape to the pasture land on its borders, where drought-stricken grass overtakes acres of what was previously forest.   As president-elect Lula Da Silva comes into power, projects like this are now at the crossroads of climate and political history in Brazil, a country that is home to one of the planet\u2019s most significant stores of biodiversity.  For nearly four years, the government of President Jair Bolsonaro was accused of undoing the environment progress of Lula, who served as president from 2003 through 2010. Data from Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research show the rate of deforestation under Bolsonaro\u2019s presidency climbed by more than 70% from 2018 to 2021. Already the Amazon rainforest is emitting more carbon dioxide than it absorbs in some locations \u2014 a shift that could have an enormous negative impact on global warming trends. And scientists warn the precious rainforest is nearing a point of irreversible decline and is less capable of recovering from disturbances like drought, logging and wildfires.   Lula\u2019s record as former president shows his government was able to cut deforestation rates dramatically by the end of his term in 2010. And his new promise goes even further: to reach zero deforestation in Brazil. This would be substantially more ambitious than his previous government\u2019s goal to eliminate illegal deforestation, not deforestation of all kinds.  Speaking at the UN\u2019s COP27 climate summit on Wednesday in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, Lula told a jam-packed conference room that \u201cBrazil is back to resume its ties with the world,\u201d and there is \u201cno climate security for the world without a protected Amazon, and we will do whatever it takes to have a different vision in the degradation.\u201d He also promised to punish those who are responsible for the deforestation in Amazon, and announced a new ministry for indigenous people \u201cso that the indigenous people themselves can present and propose to the government about policies that can derive their survival with dignity and security, peace and sustainability.\u201d His remarks were met with huge applause that trickled out of the conference room into the hallway, where people who were not able to get into the crowded room, but eager to hear Lula speak on the climate crisis, watched from their phones.  But Bolsonaro allies, who continue to control congress, could make climate action much more difficult over the next four years. One of those allies is Ricardo Salles, Bolsonaro\u2019s former environment minister and now a newly elected lawmaker in Brazil\u2019s conservative-leaning congress.   In an interview with CNN, Salles said he and others are willing to work with Lula\u2019s incoming administration on climate goals, but cautioned it should not come at the expense of economic development. \u201cI was the only guy as minister of environment in the entire history of the ministry who brought these economic questions to the table,\u201d said Salles. During his time as environment minister, the Bolsonaro government often described development and economic activity in the Amazon as vital to longterm sustainability \u2013 an approach decried by many environmental activists in the country. Salles says Brazil will have to work closely now with international allies into order to tap the billions of dollars in climate funds and carbon credits now on offer both by governments and businesses worldwide. But climate advocates argue neither Brazil nor the planet can afford the kind of compromises now being advocated by Bolsonaro allies.   \u201cWe don\u2019t need to destroy to develop. We can do that in harmony with nature. And it\u2019s the indigenous peoples who teach that,\u201d Brazilian indigenous leader Txai Suru\u00ed told CNN. Suru\u00ed said she is optimistic Lula\u2019s government will make good on promises to act quickly, despite the economic pressure from not only Bolsonaro allies, but millions in the Amazon whose livelihoods depend on its commercial development. \u201cBecause that agenda \u2014 of the Amazon, of climate change, of the environment \u2014 it\u2019s a global agenda,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Lula does not address it, it won\u2019t just be us, indigenous people, that will be knocking on his door, it\u2019ll be the entire world.\u201d The urgency to commit to those goals is not lost on Pinto who says it\u2019s not just Brazil\u2019s future that is at stake. \u201cWe need to understand as a nation that is key for the planet and that decisions we will make will be important for us but also for others,\u201d he says.

With Democrats holding two-thirds-plus majorities in both houses of this state\u2019s Legislature, they could draw any lines they wished, should the Supreme Court find for the North Carolina Republicans.", "Does anyone seriously think a Democratic-drawn plan here would have enabled narrow victories for Republican representatives like John Duarte, Michelle Steel, Mike Garcia, David Valadao, Kevin Kiley or Young Kim, without whom there is no GOP majority? Does anyone seriously think a Democratic-drawn plan would have set up Orange County Democrat Katie Porter for several nail-biting post-election weeks?", "There\u2019s not a chance of that. Nor would there be any chance for Republicans, as they just did, to take away a formerly Democratic seat in Oregon and maintain all its seats in Washington state. The same in Illinois and New York, scene of a major Republican upset.", "So there is plenty of room for backfire if the Supreme Court goes extreme in granting state legislators almost unchecked power.", "And what if the high court gave Republican-led legislatures in states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania authority to substitute presidential electors different from those chosen by voters, and those legislatures then actually did that and reversed a national election outcome?", "Does the Supreme Court seriously believe only extremist far-right activists are capable of reacting with an insurrection? If so, they\u2019ve forgotten the almost anonymous leftists of Antifa, who in 2020 and 2021 rioted and took over parts of cities like Portland and Seattle.", "So here\u2019s a cautionary word to the conservative Supreme Court majority: If you open Pandora\u2019s Box and sow the wind by changing America\u2019s traditional political and electoral checks and balances, you could live to reap whatever whirlwind might follow."]}
